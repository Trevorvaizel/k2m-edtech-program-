# Copy Examples: JTBD Validation Applied

**Testing the Attention Framework with Real-World Insights**

---

## Student Audience: Gap Year, University-Bound

### Validated JTBD Truth

**Core Job:** "Help me feel ready for university before I get there and realize everyone else already knows things I don't"

**Validated Anxieties:**
- "Feeling behind" everyone else
- "Imposter syndrome" – "not for people like me"
- Rural vs. Nairobi kids disparity
- "Wasting time" during gap year
- Fear of being "stuck" after graduation

**Validated Language:**
- "Stuck," "behind," "wasting time"
- "Everyone else already knows things I don't"
- "Not for people like me"

---

### Copy Application: Module Combinations

#### Example 1: Fear of Falling Behind

**JTBD:** "Don't want to realize everyone else already knows things I don't"

**Module Selection:** M1 + M3 + M7

> Sometimes it feels like everyone else already knows things you don't. [M1: Destabilize]
>
> The habits you form during your gap year will follow you into university. [M3: Pressure]
>
> Some people arrive ready. Others spend their first year catching up. [M3 continues]
>
> The difference isn't being smart. It's knowing how to learn. [M4: Reframe - added for depth]
>
> What would it look like to stop feeling behind? [M7: Exit]

**Why it works:**
- M1 names the felt tension ("feels like everyone else knows")
- M3 shows inevitable cost ("habits will follow you")
- M7 leaves question open (no closure)

**Test:** Can you grasp it in 3 seconds? Yes. Does it respect attention? Yes.

---

#### Example 2: Not For People Like Me

**JTBD:** "Rural student feeling different/behind compared to Nairobi kids"

**Module Selection:** M2 + M5 + M6

> Most students from outside Nairobi feel anxious about university. [M2: Expose]
>
> You've heard the Nairobi kids have advantages you don't. [M2 continues]
>
> The gap isn't intelligence. It's exposure. [M4: Reframe]
>
> Very few gap year students take the time to build skills that actually level the playing field. [M5: Identity]
>
> You can spend this year preparing to compete. Or show up and hope for the best. [M6: Agency]
>
> The year passes either way. You're choosing what it prepares you for. [M6 continues]

**Why it works:**
- M2 names invisible script ("anxious about Nairobi kids")
- M4 reframes (gap = exposure, not intelligence)
- M5 touches identity ("very few students take the time")
- M6 returns agency without rescue

**Test:** Does it feel like conversation? Yes. Does it create aspiration? Yes.

---

#### Example 3: Wasting Time

**JTBD:** "Don't want to waste gap year sitting at home"

**Module Selection:** M1 + M3 + M5

> You've finished high school. Now what? [M1: Destabilize]
>
> Every month you spend waiting at home, you're not just standing still. You're falling behind. [M3: Pressure]
>
> Some gap years launch careers. Others become a gap in the resume. [M3 continues]
>
> The students who arrive at university ready aren't the ones who spent more time studying. [M4: Reframe]
>
> They're the ones who learned how to think, not just what to think. [M4 continues]
>
> Very few people use their gap year to build skills that matter for university. [M5: Identity]
>
> What would your first year look like if you arrived already ahead? [M7: Exit]

**Why it works:**
- M1 interrupts default frame ("now what?")
- M3 makes staying costly ("falling behind")
- M4 reframes success (thinking > studying)
- M5 creates aspiration ("very few people")

**Test:** Is friction low? Yes (relatable question). Does it create urgency? Yes (inevitability).

---

### Student Copy Principles

**1. Validate Before You Pivot**
Start with "feeling behind" before offering solution
- Don't say: "We'll help you succeed!"
- Say: "Sometimes it feels like everyone else knows things you don't"

**2. Exposure, Not Intelligence**
Reframe the gap as exposure difference, not capability
- "The gap isn't intelligence. It's exposure."

**3. Make Time the Pressure, Not Failure**
Gap year anxiety is about wasting time, not failing
- "The year passes either way. You're choosing what it prepares you for."

**4. Concrete Before Abstract**
Don't say: "AI literacy for university readiness"
Say: "Arrive at university already knowing how to use AI"

**5. Test: The 3-Second Rule**
Can a student grasp the tension immediately?
- ✅ "Sometimes it feels like everyone else already knows things you don't"
- ❌ "Bridge the digital divide with foundational AI competencies"

---

## Parent Audience: University-Bound Children

### Validated JTBD Truth

**Core Job:** "Give my child what the Nairobi kids already have, so they walk into university ready to compete"

**Validated Anxieties:**
- "Throwing money away" on programs that don't work
- "Will they finish it?" – completion anxiety
- "See that it's working" – need visible results
- "Real vs. scam" – trust concerns
- Don't understand AI themselves (70% worry about AI in education)
- Fear child being "left behind"

**Validated Language:**
- "Wasted money," "scam," "proof it works"
- "See results," "tangible outcomes"
- "Left behind," "Nairobi kids have advantages"

---

### Copy Application: Module Combinations

#### Example 1: Throwing Money Away

**JTBD:** "Don't waste money on programs that don't work"

**Module Selection:** M2 + M3 + M4 + M6

> Most parents worry about paying for programs their child doesn't finish. [M2: Expose]
>
> The cost isn't just the money. It's the time your child could have spent actually getting ready. [M3: Pressure]
>
> The question isn't "which program looks impressive?" [M4: Reframe]
>
> The question is "what will my child be able to DO after this?" [M4 continues]
>
> You can invest in skills your child uses in university from day one. [M5: Identity]
>
> Or you can hope they catch up on their own. [M6: Agency]
>
> Either way, university arrives in [number of months]. You're choosing how prepared they are. [M6 continues]

**Why it works:**
- M2 names the fear ("don't finish")
- M3 expands cost (money + time)
- M4 reframes from "impressive" to "what can they DO"
- M5 creates aspiration (skills from day one)
- M6 returns agency (hope vs. invest)

**Test:** Does it address the real anxiety? Yes (completion + ROI). Is it concrete? Yes.

---

#### Example 2: Don't Understand AI

**JTBD:** "70% of Kenyan parents worry about AI in education"

**Module Selection:** M1 + M2 + M4

> 70% of Kenyan parents say AI is the biggest challenge in education. [M1: Destabilize - specificity]
>
> But very few know what that actually means for their child. [M2: Expose]
>
> You've heard AI will change everything. You haven't heard how to prepare your child for that change. [M2 continues]
>
> The question isn't "should my child use AI?" [M4: Reframe]
>
> The question is "does my child know how to think when AI is everywhere?" [M4 continues]
>
> Some students arrive at university already knowing how to work with AI. Others spend their first year figuring it out. [M3: Pressure]
>
> The difference isn't access to tools. It's knowing how to use them. [M4 continues]

**Why it works:**
- M1 uses specificity ("70%") to signal depth
- M2 names gap (heard AI changes, but not how to prepare)
- M4 reframes (tools vs. thinking)
- M3 creates comparison (ready vs. figuring it out)

**Test:** Does it validate parent concern without panic? Yes (inevitable, not threatening).

---

#### Example 3: See That It's Working

**JTBD:** "Need visible, tangible results from investment"

**Module Selection:** M2 + M5 + M6

> Most programs promise to "transform" your child. [M2: Expose]
>
> Very few show you exactly what they'll be able to DO after. [M5: Identity]
>
> By week 4, your child will stop guessing when AI works and why it fails. [M1: Destabilize - concrete outcome]
>
> By week 8, they'll be using AI for real university-level work. [M1 continues]
>
> You'll see the shift. Not because we tell you it happened. [M6: Agency]
>
> Because they'll show you what they can do that they couldn't do before. [M6 continues]
>
> Some parents invest in appearance. Others invest in capability. [M5: Identity]
>
> What would it look like if your child could show you their work, not just their certificate? [M7: Exit]

**Why it works:**
- M2 exposes empty promises ("transform" without specifics)
- M5 creates aspiration ("very few show what they can DO")
- M1 uses concrete outcomes (stop guessing, university-level work)
- M6 returns agency (show you, don't tell you)
- M7 leaves open question (certificate vs. work they can show)

**Test:** Is friction low? Yes (specific timeline). Can they see results? Yes (week 4, week 8).

---

#### Example 4: Nairobi Kids Advantage

**JTBD:** "Want child to have what Nairobi kids already have"

**Module Selection:** M2 + M4 + M3 + M6

> Most parents outside Nairobi worry their children are at a disadvantage. [M2: Expose]
>
> The gap isn't access to AI tools. Those are everywhere now. [M4: Reframe]
>
> The gap is knowing how to use them. [M4 continues]
>
> Students from Nairobi schools aren't ahead because they have better technology. [M2 continues]
>
> They're ahead because they learned how to think alongside AI. [M4 continues]
>
> Your child doesn't need what Nairobi kids have. [M4 continues - dissolve old question]
>
> Your child needs the same skill: knowing how to use AI to learn faster, not cheat. [M4 continues]
>
> Some students arrive at university ready. Others spend first year catching up. [M3: Pressure]
>
> You can give your child that head start before university arrives. [M6: Agency]
>
> Or you can hope they figure it out on their own. [M6 continues]

**Why it works:**
- M2 validates fear without judgment ("worry about disadvantage")
- M4 reframes gap (not technology, but thinking skills)
- M4 dissolves old question (don't need what Nairobi kids have, need the same skill)
- M3 shows inevitable cost (ready vs. catching up)
- M6 returns agency (give head start vs. hope)

**Test:** Does it feel like accusation? No (observational tone). Does it create hope? Yes (same skill is accessible).

---

### Parent Copy Principles

**1. Specificity Signals Depth**
Use validated statistics and concrete timelines
- "70% of Kenyan parents"
- "By week 4, your child will stop guessing"

**2. Reframe the Gap**
It's not access (everyone has tools now), it's capability (knowing how to use them)
- "The gap isn't access to AI tools. It's knowing how to use them."

**3. Make Time the Pressure**
University arrives in [X] months – make that the urgency
- "University arrives in 6 months. You're choosing how prepared they are."

**4. Show, Don't Tell**
Promise visible outcomes, not transformation
- "They'll show you what they can do, not just their certificate"

**5. Return Agency Without Rescue**
Give clear choice, don't sell hard
- "You can invest in skills. Or hope they catch up. Either way, university arrives."

**6. Test: The "Scam" Filter**
Would this convince a skeptical parent?
- ❌ "Revolutionary AI transformation program"
- ✅ "By week 4, they'll stop guessing when AI works"

## Testing the Framework

### The 3-Second Comprehension Test

**Student Example:**
> "Sometimes it feels like everyone else already knows things you don't."

✅ Graspable immediately? Yes.
✅ Validates felt tension? Yes.

**Parent Example:**
> "Most parents worry about paying for programs their child doesn't finish."

✅ Graspable immediately? Yes.
✅ Names real anxiety? Yes.

---

### The "I Can't Unsee It" Test

After reading, does the copy echo?

**Student:**
> "The year passes either way. You're choosing what it prepares you for."

✅ Creates reflection about time use
✅ No closure – question stays active

**Parent:**
> "Some parents invest in appearance. Others invest in capability."

✅ Creates self-reflection
✅ High stakes (identity choice)

---

### The Abstraction Leakage Test

Are we using Layer 3 language with Layer 1 audience?

❌ **Leakage:** "Build foundational AI competencies for university readiness"
✅ **Layer 1:** "Arrive at university already knowing how to use AI"

❌ **Leakage:** "Navigate the digital divide with cognitive architecture"
✅ **Layer 1:** "Students from Nairobi aren't ahead because of better technology. They're ahead because they learned how to think alongside AI."

---

## Summary: What Works

### Student Copy That Lands

1. **Names the tension first:** "feeling behind," "wasting time"
2. **Makes time the pressure:** "gap year passes either way"
3. **Reframes as skill, not smarts:** "thinking vs. what to think"
4. **Leaves question open:** "What would it look like if..."

### Parent Copy That Lands

1. **Validates the money anxiety:** "programs they don't finish"
2. **Promises visible outcomes:** "by week 4, they'll stop guessing"
3. **Reframes the gap:** "not access, but knowing how to use"
4. **Returns agency:** "invest in skills vs. hope they catch up"

### Both Audiences: Core Principles

1. **Concrete before abstract** – "wasting time" not "suboptimal gap year utilization"
2. **Experience before explanation** – they feel seen, then you offer solution
3. **Inevitability not panic** – "year passes either way" not "act now or fail"
4. **Conversation not announcement** – "sometimes it feels like" not "transform your future"

---

## The Framework Works When...

✅ The first sentence names a felt tension
✅ The cost feels inevitable, not threatening
✅ The reframe dissolves the old question
✅ Agency returns without step-by-step rescue
✅ The exit leaves tension active

## The Framework Fails When...

❌ First sentence announces features
❌ Pressure creates fear ("you'll fail without this")
❌ Reframe answers instead of dissolves
❌ Agency includes "follow our 5-step system"
❌ Exit provides tidy conclusion or CTA
