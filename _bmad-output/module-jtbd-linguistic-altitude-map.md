# MODULE: JTBD × Linguistic Altitude Mapping

**The Missing Layer: Respecting the JTBD Through Abstraction Altitude**

*"Same mission. Different altitudes. Know who you're speaking to."*

---

## 🎯 THE CORE PRINCIPLE

> **Your philosophy can be high-altitude. Your copy must match the JTBD altitude.**

You can BELIEVE in "democratization of expertise" (Level 5 abstraction).

But when writing to a **student who just needs to not feel stupid in Week 1** (Level 1 JTBD), you speak Level 1 language.

**This is not dumbing down. This is RESPECTING ATTENTION.**

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         JTBD ALTITUDE × LINGUISTIC ABSTRACTION MAP           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ALTITUDE 1: STUDENTS (Ground Level - Immediate Concrete)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

JTBD (from research):
"Help me feel ready for university before I get there and
 realize everyone else already knows things I don't."

Emotional Territory:
• Anxiety (75% report anxiety entering university)
• Fear of looking stupid
• Pressure to justify gap year
• "Everyone else already knows"

Linguistic Altitude: LEVEL 1-2 (Concrete → Pattern)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR:

Level 1 (Concrete Problem):
✅ "Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers get hired."
✅ "You've done it: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, submit."
✅ "Stop feeling confused when you use AI."
✅ "Sometimes AI works. Sometimes it doesn't. You don't know why."

Level 2 (Visible Pattern):
✅ "The habits you form now follow you forever."
✅ "Students who thrive build invisible writing muscles."
✅ "You start noticing why AI works sometimes and fails other times."

WHAT THEY DON'T NEED (TOO HIGH):
❌ "AI is the democratization of expertise"
❌ "Navigate the AI landscape"
❌ "Extension of consciousness"
❌ "Territory cartography and perception zones"

WHY: They don't need the MAP. They need to know IT WORKS FOR THEM.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ALTITUDE 2: PARENTS (Medium - Protective/Proof)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

JTBD (from research):
"Give my child what the Nairobi kids already have, so they
 walk into university ready to compete."

Emotional Territory:
• Worry (70% worried about AI)
• Fear of wasting money (15K bootcamp quit after 2 days)
• Need for visible proof ("I'd see the change")
• Social pressure (church groups, WhatsApp networks)

Linguistic Altitude: LEVEL 2-3 (Pattern → Framework)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR:

Level 2 (Pattern Recognition):
✅ "Other parents are paying 15K for bootcamps their kids quit.
    This one's different."
✅ "The difference? 200 students learning together won't let them quit."
✅ "By Week 6, your child will demonstrate what they've learned."

Level 3 (Framework/System):
✅ "The cohort structure keeps them accountable."
✅ "K2M builds invisible writing muscles through structured practice."
✅ "This closes the gap between your child and Nairobi kids."

WHAT THEY DON'T NEED (TOO HIGH):
❌ "AI as extension of consciousness"
❌ "Democratizing expertise through cognitive science"
❌ "Revolutionary hope for amplified intelligence"

WHY: They need SAFETY + PROOF, not philosophy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ALTITUDE 3: PRINCIPALS (High - Institutional/Competitive)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

JTBD (from research):
"Have something to tell parents at admissions meetings that
 makes us look modern and keeps enrollment stable."

Emotional Territory:
• Competitive pressure (enrollment down 12%)
• Vendor burnout (150K STEM program disappeared)
• Need for "proof from schools like mine"
• Want marketable differentiator

Linguistic Altitude: LEVEL 3-4 (Framework → Transformation)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR:

Level 3 (System/Framework):
✅ "Turnkey AI preparation: We run it, you get the credit."
✅ "15 schools already running K2M for their Form 4 graduates."
✅ "92% completion rate vs. 5% for typical online courses."

Level 4 (Transformation/Outcomes):
✅ "Students demonstrate practical AI skills employers want."
✅ "Your students learn to think WITH AI, not just copy FROM it."
✅ "This is the answer when parents ask 'Do you teach AI?'"

CONDITIONAL: Can use Level 5 (Philosophy) IF:
• Elite international school (like Dr. Ndung'u)
• Tech-literate principal (like Dr. Mutiso)
• Already bought into mission

✅ "We're democratizing AI expertise so all students—rural,
    urban, technical, creative—can compete."

WHY: They need COMPETITIVE POSITIONING + OUTCOMES, but SOME
     can handle higher philosophy if already aligned.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE (Level 5):
Use this INTERNALLY, in MANIFESTOS, with BELIEVERS

"AI is the democratization of expertise—an extension of
 consciousness that makes mastery accessible to all."

WHERE TO USE:
• Internal documents
• Brand manifesto
• Fellow educators who share the vision
• After someone is already bought in

WHERE NOT TO USE:
• Cold student-facing copy
• Parent conversion content
• First-touch principal pitches
```

    ChatGPT and you realize everyone else already knows."

❌ "Navigate the AI landscape with future-proof skills."
❌ "Transform your cognitive relationship with AI."
```

```

---

### FOR PARENTS (Level 2-3)

**Opening Lines (Level 2 - Pattern):**
```
✅ "Other parents are paying 15K for bootcamps their kids quit
    after 2 days. This one's different."
✅ "You lie awake wondering if they're ready. You've done
    everything you can. But the world they're entering isn't
    the one you knew."

    but you don't fully understand AI yourself."

❌ "Democratize expertise for your child."
❌ "AI as cognitive extension for the next generation."
```

**Body Copy (Level 3 - Framework):**
```
✅ "K2M is different because it's not another video course
    your child will abandon. It's 200 students learning
    together. Daily practice. Real accountability."

❌ "Join the movement to democratize AI expertise."
❌ "Revolutionary hope for education transformation."
```

**Body Copy (Level 4 - Transformation):**
```
✅ "What you can tell parents: 'Our students learn AI before
    university through the K2M program. Last year, 92%
    completed the full 6 weeks and demonstrated practical
    AI skills.'"
✅ "Students learn to think WITH AI, not just copy FROM it.
    That's the differentiator employers want."
✅ "Other schools in your area have robotics labs, coding clubs.
    Whether those work is beside the point—they look modern.
    What do you have to show?"

Can go Level 5 IF already bought in:
✅ "We're democratizing AI expertise so all students—rural,
    urban, technical, creative—can compete on equal footing."
```

**CTA (Level 3-4):**
```
✅ "Request a pilot proposal"

## 🎯 PRACTICAL WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step: Writing Copy That Respects JTBD Altitude

```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE JTBD
───────────────────────────
Ask: "Who am I writing to and what job are they hiring for?"

Example:
• Persona: Student (gap year, anxious)
• JTBD: "Stop feeling confused and be ready for university"
• Altitude: Level 1-2 (Concrete/Pattern)

STEP 2: EXTRACT THE TRUTH
──────────────────────────
What's the JTBD truth from research?

Example:
• "75% anxiety entering university"
• "Everyone else already knows things I don't"
• "Copy-pasting creates dependency"

STEP 3: FIND THE FELT TENSION
──────────────────────────────
What's the immediate, concrete pain?

Example:
• "Sometimes AI works, sometimes it doesn't"
• "You don't know why it fails"
• "You're afraid to ask because everyone else seems to get it"

STEP 4: WRITE AT THE RIGHT ALTITUDE
────────────────────────────────────
Match language to persona altitude

❌ Level 5 (Too high):
"AI is the democratization of expertise"

❌ Level 4 (Still too high):
"Transform your cognitive relationship with AI"

✅ Level 2 (Right altitude for students):
"Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers thrive."

✅ Level 1 (Hook - ground level):
"Sometimes AI works. Sometimes it doesn't. You don't know why."

STEP 5: TEST
────────────
Run through checklist:
[ ] Would grandma understand this? (for students/parents)
[ ] Does it create "I can't unsee it"?
[ ] Does it sound like a conversation, not an announcement?
```

## 🔄 BEFORE/AFTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Student Conversion Copy

**BEFORE (Too High - Level 4-5):**
```
"Navigate the AI landscape and transform your cognitive
 relationship with technology through our revolutionary
 approach to democratized expertise."

ALTITUDE: Level 4-5
PROBLEM: Student JTBD is Level 1-2. This is 3 levels too high.
RESULT: Sounds like marketing slop. Student scrolls past.
```

**AFTER (Right Altitude - Level 1-2):**
```
"Sometimes AI works. Sometimes it doesn't. You don't know why.

You've done it: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, submit assignment. It feels
productive. But you're not learning.

Copy-pasters get stuck in internships. Thinkers get hired.

The difference? Invisible writing muscles—the ability to think
without looking at notes.

Join 200 students building these habits before university starts."

ALTITUDE: Level 1 (hook) → Level 2 (pattern)
ALIGNMENT: Matches student JTBD perfectly
RESULT: "I can't unsee this. That's me."
```

---

### Example 2: Parent Conversion Copy

**BEFORE (Too High - Level 5):**
```
"Empower your child through the democratization of AI expertise
 as we extend human consciousness through revolutionary pedagogy."

ALTITUDE: Level 5
PROBLEM: Parent JTBD is Level 2-3. This is 2+ levels too high.
RESULT: Sounds like buzzwords. Parent doesn't trust it.
```

**AFTER (Right Altitude - Level 2-3):**
```
"You lie awake wondering if they're ready.

You've paid for everything. School fees. Textbooks. That coding
bootcamp they quit after 2 days.

70% of Kenyan parents share this worry. Your child is walking
into a world where AI changes everything—and you don't even
understand it yourself.

Here's what's different about K2M:

The cohort structure. 200 students learning together. When your
child sees others showing up, they show up too. No more quitting
after 2 days.

By Week 6, you'll see visible proof. Not a certificate—actual
ability you can watch them demonstrate.

3,500 KES. Less than that bootcamp. Less than four years of
worrying they're not ready.

Join 200 families preparing their children together."

ALTITUDE: Level 2 (pattern) → Level 3 (framework)
ALIGNMENT: Matches parent JTBD (proof, belonging, safety)
RESULT: "This speaks to me. I trust this."
```

---

### Example 3: Principal B2B Copy

**BEFORE (Too High - Level 5):**
```
"Partner with us to democratize AI expertise and extend human
 consciousness through revolutionary hope pedagogy."

ALTITUDE: Level 5
PROBLEM: Principal JTBD is Level 3-4. This is abstract philosophy.
RESULT: Sounds fluffy. Principal needs outcomes, not philosophy.
```

**AFTER (Right Altitude - Level 3-4):**
```
"Parents are asking: 'Do you teach AI?'

You know the question. It comes up at every admissions tour.

Other schools have robotics labs, coding clubs. Whether those
actually work is beside the point—they look modern.

What do you have to show?

K2M gives you a credible answer without the headache:

• We run the 6-week cohort (curriculum, facilitation, tracking)
• You get completion data for your admissions materials
• 92% completion rate (vs. 5% for typical online courses)

What you can tell parents:

'Our students learn AI before university through K2M. Last year,
 92% of participants completed the full 6 weeks and demonstrated
 practical AI skills employers want.'

15 schools are already running K2M. Is yours next?

ALTITUDE: Level 3 (framework) → Level 4 (transformation)
ALIGNMENT: Matches principal JTBD (competitive, proof, easy)
RESULT: "This solves my problem. Let's talk."

**Your mission IS "democratization of expertise."**

But to a student who just needs to feel ready for Week 1:

"Democratization" is noise.
"Stop feeling confused" is signal.

**Same outcome. Different door.**
