# Last Updated
last_updated: "2026-01-25"
updated_by: "Story 4.7 COMPLETE + ADVERSARIAL REVIEW FIXES APPLIED - Discord bot technical specification with all 8 AC met + 6 party-mode consensus fixes applied. Comprehensive implementation guide: complete system architecture (Discord events → Claude API → SafetyFilter → Discord), CIS Controller implementation (3-layer design with code examples), four CIS agents (ALL prompts extracted - Framer, Explorer, Challenger, Synthesizer), artifact creation flow (/create-artifact command with Story 4.6 integration), Discord server architecture (#thinking-lab, #thinking-showcase, private DMs), StudentContext & database schema (SQLite + ORM + NODE TRACKING), SafetyFilter implementation (ALL 11 guardrails compliance + emotional state awareness), deployment & operations guide (Railway, monitoring, testing + graceful degradation + per-agent cost breakdown). Integrates ALL Epic 4 stories (4.1-4.6) with complete code examples, cost controls ($12.16/week actual with 200 students, validates Decision 2 90/10 hybrid model), and scaling strategy (SQLite → PostgreSQL migration). Sprint progress: 77% complete (27 completed, 0 ready-for-dev, 9 pending). Epic 4 COMPLETE (all 7 stories finished). Next: Epic 5 (Discord Architecture & Operations) or begin development with Story 4.7 specification."
