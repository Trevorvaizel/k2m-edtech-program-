# Story 1.1: Core Guardrails - Preserved & Enhanced for v2

**Epic:** 1 - Philosophy & Framework
**Story:** 1.1 - Review and preserve core guardrails from v1
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Created:** 2026-01-22
**Purpose:** Foundation layer - Load-bearing walls that protect framework purity, student safety, and scalability

---

## v1 → v2 GUARDRAIL INVENTORY

All guardrails from v1 have been reviewed. **Status: ALL PRESERVED** with annotations for v2 context.

---

## GUARDRAIL #1: WHAT THIS COHORT ACTUALLY IS

**Purpose:** Identity Protection - Prevents scope creep and mission drift
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Enhanced with JTBD language

### We are NOT:
- Teaching AI tools or prompts
- Certifying technical skills
- Creating portfolio projects
- Teaching "advanced" AI systems
- A traditional course

### We ARE:
- Moving learners through **perceptual zones** (Zone 0 → early Zone 4)
- Installing **durable thinking habits**
- Creating **identity shifts** ("AI is not for me" → "I work with AI intentionally")
- Designing for **psychological safety**, not performance
- Building **confidence that transfers** to university and SME contexts

**v2 Enhancement - JTBD Translation:**
- **Functional Job:** "Help me move from confusion to clarity in AI before university starts"
- **Emotional Job:** "Help me stop feeling anxious and start feeling like I belong"
- **Social Job:** "Give me proof I can show to myself, my parents, and my future"

**v2 Context:** Agent-facilitated model (90/10 hybrid) preserves these principles better than human facilitators (no advice-giving drift).

---

## GUARDRAIL #2: THE ZONE PROGRESSION FRAMEWORK

**Purpose:** Structural Foundation - The core mental model of the entire program
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Now serves as identity shift map

### The Zone Progression (Internal Framework)

**Zone 0:** "AI is not for me / it's sci-fi"
→ **Zone 1:** "AI is something I could use"
→ **Zone 2:** "AI does tasks for me"
→ **Zone 3:** "AI understands my intent / I collaborate with it"
→ **Zone 4:** "I control quality / I direct AI"

**Our Target (6 Weeks):** Zone 0 → early Zone 4

**v2 Enhancement - Node Integration:**
Each zone transition now has **specific nodes** (Decision 10) that install the identity shift:
- **Zone 0→1 (Wonder)**: 4 nodes (witnessing → relatability → permission → fun)
- **Zone 1→2 (Trust)**: 4 nodes (contrast → wins → safety → habit)
- **Zone 2→3 (Converse)**: 4 nodes (context → conversation → meta-awareness → refinement)
- **Zone 3→4 (Direct)**: 4 nodes (iteration → ownership → skill → director identity)

**v2 Context:** Valid outcome is Zone 2-3 (Decision 4) - Journey A completion is a success.

---

## GUARDRAIL #3: DESIGN GUARDRAILS (NEVER DO)

**Purpose:** Safety Rails - Prevents intimidation, comparison, and performance anxiety
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Critical for agent-facilitated model

### We NEVER:
1. **Use technical jargon in Week 1**
   - *Why:* Zone 0 students are scared of " sounding stupid"
   - *v2 Context:* Agent prompts must follow this - no tech-heavy language in Week 1 node content

2. **Show "impressive" AI outputs**
   - *Why:* Creates intimidation, "I could never do that"
   - *v2 Context:* NotebookLM podcasts and node examples must show RELATABLE outputs, not impressive ones

3. **Compare students or rank outputs**
   - *Why:* Destroys psychological safety
   - *v2 Context:* Agent must NEVER surface comparisons like "top 3 reflections" - only aggregate visibility

4. **Praise speed or "correctness"**
   - *Why:* Rewards performance, encourages rushing
   - *v2 Context:* Agent feedback should celebrate thinking, not speed/accuracy

5. **Talk about "building," "automation," or "systems"**
   - *Why:* Premature for Zone 0-2, sounds like work/business
   - *v2 Context:* Save these terms for Zone 3-4 only

6. **Evaluate or grade artifacts**
   - *Why:* Shifts focus to external validation
   - *v2 Context:* Self-assessment with proof-of-work (Decision 5) - no agent grading

**v2 Context - Agent Behavior:**
All automated interventions must respect these NEVER rules. This is **framework purity protection** - the reason we chose agent-facilitated model (Decision 1).

---

## GUARDRAIL #4: DESIGN GUARDRAILS (ALWAYS DO)

**Purpose:** Quality Standards - Ensures consistent student experience
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Core principles for node design and agent interactions

### We ALWAYS:
1. **Prioritize clarity over cleverness**
   - *v2 Application:* Node content, agent prompts, daily prompts - all must be crystal clear

2. **Prioritize confidence over competence**
   - *v2 Application:* Celebrate small wins, normalize confusion, build momentum

3. **Normalize confusion ("this is normal")**
   - *v2 Application:* Agent responses should use "many students feel..." language

4. **Use repetition over novelty**
   - *v2 Application:* The 4 Habits appear in every node, session, prompt - reinforcement, not variety

5. **Create psychological safety**
   - *v2 Application:* Private CIS conversations, no public shaming, escalation paths for stuck students

6. **Frame AI as responding to thinking, not intelligence**
   - *v2 Application:* Every node should emphasize "better thinking → better AI responses"

**v2 Context - The 4 Habits:**
These ALWAYS principles operationalize the 4 Core Habits (detailed in Story 1.4).

---

## GUARDRAIL #5: THE 4 CORE HABITS

**Purpose:** Value Proposition - The tangible outcome students "buy"
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Will be branded in Story 1.4 as graduation-proof markers

### By Week 6, students will have these habits:

1. **Pause before asking** → "What do I actually want?"
2. **Explain context first** → "Here's my situation..."
3. **Change one thing at a time** → "What does this affect?"
4. **Use AI before decisions** → "Help me think, not just answer"

**If they keep these habits, the cohort succeeded. Tools change, habits transfer.**

**v2 Enhancement (see Story 1.4):**
- These habits become **graduation artifacts** - visible, tangible proof
- Aligned with **Dual Pillars** (Decision 17):
  - Habits 1 & 2 = Democratized Intelligence (better thinking)
  - Habits 3 & 4 = Democratized Expertise (better knowledge access)
- Mapped to **JTBD Social Job**: "Give me proof I can show to myself, my parents, and my future"

## v2-SPECIFIC GUARDRAILS (NEW)

These emerge from v2 decisions and extend v1 principles:

### Guardrail #6: Agent-Facilitated Model Purity

**Purpose:** Prevents "human-ness" drift that breaks framework

**Agent Capabilities (90%):**
- All mechanical tasks (prompts, tracking, nudges, reactions)
- All template interventions
- All gating/progression
- Peer visibility aggregation (without comparison/ranking)
- CIS agent conversations (/frame, /diverge, /challenge, /synthesize)

**Trevor Capabilities (10%):**
- Friday spot-check: 15-20 student reflections
- 1-hour live sessions (alternating days per cluster)
- Escalations: Agent flags students stuck 3+ days
- Culture monitoring: Are norms being followed?

**Protective Rule:** Agents must NEVER give advice, opinions, or personalized guidance outside of structured CIS roles. This prevents the advice-giving drift that human facilitators inevitably show.

---

### Guardrail #7: Zone Node Content Quality

**Purpose:** Ensures node-based learning delivers identity shifts

**Every Node Must:**
1. **Target a specific zone transition** (0→1, 1→2, 2→3, or 3→4)
2. **Address one emotional job** (belonging, confidence, clarity, ownership)
3. **Model one 4 Habit** (pause, explain, change, use before deciding)
4. **Be NotebookLM-compatible** (can be delivered as conversational podcast)
5. **Pass the "So what?" test** - Student should feel "This is about ME, not AI"

**Quality Checklist (for Story 2.6):**
- [ ] Zone transition explicit?
- [ ] Emotional job targeted?
- [ ] 4 Habit reinforced?
- [ ] Identity shift visible?
- [ ] Example is relatable, not impressive?

---

### Guardrail #8: Discord Hybrid Model Safety

**Purpose:** Balances private process with public celebration

**Architecture (Decision 12):**
```
#thinking-lab (instructions + entry point)
    ↓
Private DM/Thread (CIS agent interactions)
    ↓ (safe, messy thinking documented)
    ↓
#thinking-showcase (finished artifacts celebrated)
```

**Safety Rules:**
- Process is **private** (students can be messy without judgment)
- Product is **public** (peer learning from finished thinking)
- Journey is **documented** (thread becomes evidence of growth)
- Celebration is **visible** (social proof, motivation)

**Protective Rule:** Never push students to share incomplete thinking. Only showcase-ready artifacts go public.

---

### Guardrail #9: Thinking Artifact Authenticity

**Purpose:** Ensures artifact proves identity transformation, not AI usage

**Artifact Structure (Decision 13):**
```
THE QUESTION I WRESTLED WITH: [Student's chosen question]
HOW I REFRAMED IT: [Using /frame with The Framer]
WHAT I EXPLORED: [Using /diverge with The Explorer]
WHAT I CHALLENGED: [Using /challenge with The Challenger]
WHAT I CONCLUDED: [Using /synthesize with The Synthesizer]
WHAT THIS TAUGHT ME: [Reflection on thinking growth]
```

**Authenticity Check:**
- Does this show **their thinking**, not AI's output?
- Can they **explain their choices** when asked?
- Would this artifact **convince a parent** that transformation happened?

**Guardrail:** No templates, no fill-in-the-blanks. Each artifact must be unique to the student's thinking journey.
