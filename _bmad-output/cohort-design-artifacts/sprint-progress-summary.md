## 📝 Recent Decisions & Updates

### Story 2.6 Completion - Adversarial Review & Fixes (2026-01-24)

**Adversarial Review Conducted:**
- Design Thinking Coach (Maya) completed brutal adversarial review of Story 2.6
- Identified 6 critical gaps that could break implementation
- Party mode session convened with 5 BMAD agents

**6 Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ **NotebookLM Output Validation Protocol** (transcript review system)
   - Structured process for Trevor to manually review transcripts
   - Evidence documentation with timestamps and quotes
   - Review summary template for consistency

2. ✅ **Severity Classification System** (critical/major/minor fails)
   - 🔴 CRITICAL = Guardrail violations, JTBD misalignment (must fix)
   - 🟠 MAJOR = Examples too impressive/generic, weak emotional resonance (should fix)
   - 🟡 MINOR = Polish and refinement (doesn't block deployment)

3. ✅ **Partial Compliance Protocol** (conflict resolution)
   - Deployment rules: 0 CRITICAL, 0-2 MAJOR acceptable
   - Conflict resolution when Trevor and peer reviewer disagree
   - Partial pass documentation template

4. ✅ **Emotional Resonance Preview Testing** (student panel validation)
   - Required for all Week 1 nodes and high-emotion nodes
   - 3-5 student panelists, 24-hour feedback turnaround
   - Pass/fail thresholds based on emotional resonance
   - Fast-track option when preview panel unavailable

5. ✅ **CIS Alignment Checks** (cross-epic handshakes)
   - Added to Universal Pre-Check for all nodes
   - Ensures node content matches CIS agent prompts
   - Prevents "node says one thing, agent says another" confusion
   - Cross-references to Epic 4 stories

6. ✅ **4 Habits Branding Integration** (graduation-proof references)
   - Enhanced 4 Habits Integration Check with branding elements
   - Uses branded habit language from Epic 1.4
   - Positions habits as graduation-proof skills
   - Connects to artifact and social job

**Git Commits:**
- d2ed934: "Fix Story 2.6: Address all 6 gaps from adversarial review"
- 0896a51: "Document: Experience Design Evaluation (Party Mode Session)"

**Additional Documentation:**
- `experience-design-evaluation-party-mode-2026-01-24.md` captures full party mode evaluation
- Five agents (Maya, Victor, Winston, John, Sophia) unanimously assessed design as:
  - **Value Level:** EXTRAORDINARY (world-class, category-defining)
  - **Altitude Level:** Level 4 (Transformation) with Level 5 depth
  - **Verdict:** "This deserves to exist. This deserves to scale."

### Decision Timeline Update (2026-01-23)
**Decision 11 Update:** CIS Agent Graduated Introduction
- **Original:** Full CIS suite introduced Week 4
- **Updated:** /frame introduced Week 1 (practice mode), /diverge and /challenge added Week 4, /synthesize added Week 6
- **Rationale:** Early scaffolding of Habit 1 and Habit 2, reduces facilitator burden from Week 1

### 8-Week Timeline Decision (Locked 2026-01-23)
**Decision:** Extended from 6 to 8 weeks
- **Rationale:** JTBD emotional job ("stop feeling anxious") requires adequate dwell time for identity shifts to stabilize
- **Impact:** Epic 2 stories restructured from 6 individual weeks to 4 two-week blocks
- **Zone Distribution:** Wonder (1 week), Trust (2 weeks), Converse (2 weeks), Direct (2 weeks), Consolidation (1 week)

### Guardrail #11 Addition (2026-01-23)
**New Guardrail:** JTBD-Relevant Examples
- **Requirement:** All node examples must be relevant to pre-university life transition
- **Approved:** Career exploration, study decisions, applications, understanding complex topics
- **Prohibited:** Cat poems, silly scenarios, trivial games
- **Principle:** Fun comes from RELEVANCE, not silliness
