## 📝 Recent Decisions & Updates

### Decision Timeline Update (2026-01-23)
**Decision 11 Update:** CIS Agent Graduated Introduction
- **Original:** Full CIS suite introduced Week 4
- **Updated:** /frame introduced Week 1 (practice mode), /diverge and /challenge added Week 4, /synthesize added Week 6
