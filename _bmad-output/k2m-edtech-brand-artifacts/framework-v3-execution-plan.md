# Framework V3: Execution Plan
## Surgical Edit Based on JTBD Research + Altitude Respect

**Created:** 2026-01-22
**For:** Next session with Trevor
**Storyteller:** Sophia

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM (Clear Understanding)

**What's Wrong:**
The framework uses **"invisible writing"** (a copywriting concept) and generic **"copy-paster"** language as examples of what students learn, when it should demonstrate:

1. **Actual curriculum transformations** (Territory Map progression, mental models, strategic integration)
2. **Translated into JTBD-validated language** at the correct altitude
3. **Respecting the actual anxieties and words** from validated research

**What Got Confused:**
- **Copywriting philosophy** ("invisible writing" = how to write marketing copy)
- **Curriculum content** (Territory Map, mental models, strategic AI use)

**Result:** The framework doesn't accurately represent what students actually learn.

## 📊 THE JTBD FOUNDATION (Our North Star)

### **Student JTBD (Level 1-2: Concrete/Immediate)**
**Job:** "Help me feel ready for university before I get there and realize everyone else already knows things I don't"

**Their Language:**
- "feeling behind"
- "everyone else already knows"
- "not for people like me"
- "Nairobi kids have advantages"
- "wasting gap year time"
- "proof I'm not behind"

**Their Altitude:** CONCRETE. Immediate. Social comparison. Fear-driven.

---

### **Parent JTBD (Level 2-3: Pattern/Proof)**
**Job:** "Give my child what the Nairobi kids already have, so they walk into university ready to compete"

**Their Language:**
- "throwing money away"
- "will they finish it?"
- "see that it's working"
- "real vs. scam"
- "left behind"
- "70% worry about AI" (validated stat)

**Their Altitude:** PROOF-SEEKING. Protective. Need visible results.

---

### **Principal JTBD (Level 3-4: Framework/Institutional)**
**Job:** "Have something to tell parents at admissions meetings that makes us look modern and keeps enrollment stable"

**Their Language:**
- "marketing tool"
- "keeping up with other schools"
- "burned by vendors"
- "easy to implement"
- "proof from schools like mine"

**Their Altitude:** COMPETITIVE. Risk-averse. Need differentiation.

---

## 🗺️ THE CURRICULUM (What Students Actually Learn)

**Core Transformations:**
1. **Perceptual shifts** - How they SEE AI changes (Territory Map zones)
2. **Mental models** - Frameworks for WHEN/HOW/WHY to use AI
3. **Strategic integration** - Knowing when to use AI vs. think independently
4. **Cognitive amplification** - AI as thinking partner, not tool dependency
5. **Barrier crossings** - Trust → Skill → Patience → Identity

**Zone Highlights (from Territory Map):**
- **Zone 1 → Zone 2:** From observer to delegator (trust barrier)
- **Zone 2 → Zone 3:** From delegator to collaborator (skill barrier)
- **Zone 3 → Zone 4:** From collaborator to director (patience barrier)
- **Zone 4 capabilities:** Systematic iteration, personal strategies, reliable results

## 🔧 THE TRANSLATION PATTERN (How to Fix Examples)

### **Pattern A: Student Examples (Level 1-2)**

**WRONG (Current framework):**
```
❌ "Build invisible writing muscles—think clearly without notes."
❌ "Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers thrive."
```
*Problem: Uses copywriting concept. Too abstract. Not their language.*

**RIGHT (JTBD-aligned):**
```
✅ "Stop feeling like everyone else already knows. Learn WHY AI works sometimes and fails other times."
✅ "You're not behind. You just don't know the mental models Nairobi kids learned. We'll teach you."
✅ "By Week 4: You'll know WHEN to use AI, WHEN to think on your own, HOW to steer it."
```
*Why: Uses their language ("feeling behind," "Nairobi kids"). Concrete outcomes. Level 1-2 altitude.*

---

### **Pattern B: Parent Examples (Level 2-3)**

**WRONG (Current framework):**
```
❌ "K2M builds invisible writing muscles through structured practice."
❌ "Your child will develop cognitive capabilities."
```
*Problem: Abstract. Doesn't address "will they finish?" or "is it real?" concerns.*

**RIGHT (JTBD-aligned):**
```
✅ "You'll see it working by Week 4: They'll show you what they can do that they couldn't before."
✅ "92% completion rate. Your child learns with 200 others—they won't quit like that 15K bootcamp."
✅ "Not vague 'transformation.' Concrete skills: They'll know WHEN to use AI, HOW to think independently."
```
*Why: Proof-focused. Addresses "money waste" and "will they finish" anxieties. Level 2-3 altitude.*

---

### **Pattern C: Principal Examples (Level 3-4)**

**WRONG (Current framework):**
```
❌ "Students build invisible writing muscles."
❌ "They develop thinking skills that transfer."
```
*Problem: Not institutional language. Doesn't address "what do I tell parents?" need.*

**RIGHT (JTBD-aligned):**
```
✅ "What you tell parents: 'Our students learn AI before university through K2M. 92% completed. They demonstrate practical skills employers want.'"
✅ "Turnkey: We run it, you get the credit. No teacher training needed."
✅ "Students learn to think WITH AI strategically—that's what universities and employers look for."
```
*Why: Competitive positioning. Easy implementation. Proof from similar schools. Level 3-4 altitude.*

## 📋 EXECUTION CHECKLIST (For Next Session)

### **Phase 1: Audit (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Search framework for all instances of "invisible writing" (24 found)
- [ ] Search framework for all instances of "copy-paster" (19 found)
- [ ] Mark each instance as:
  - **KEEP** (if it's actually good/appropriate)
  - **REPLACE** (wrong altitude or wrong concept)
  - **DELETE** (redundant)

### **Phase 2: Create Replacement Library (30 minutes)**
Create a reference sheet with:
- [ ] 10 student examples (Level 1-2, JTBD language)
- [ ] 10 parent examples (Level 2-3, proof-focused)
- [ ] 10 principal examples (Level 3-4, institutional)

Using:
- Actual JTBD anxieties/language
- Actual curriculum concepts (mental models, strategic integration, zones)
- Proper altitude matching

### **Phase 3: Execute Replacements (60-90 minutes)**
Go through framework section by section:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Layer -1 Examples** (lines ~300-1000) - Most critical, most visible
2. **Copy Litmus Test** (lines ~200-250) - Sets the pattern
3. **Emotional Arc Examples** (lines ~1700-1850) - High impact
4. **5-Gear Examples** (lines ~1880-1970) - Conversion-critical

For each section:
- [ ] Read the context
- [ ] Identify the persona (Student/Parent/Principal)
- [ ] Check the altitude (Level 1-2 / 2-3 / 3-4)
- [ ] Replace with JTBD-aligned example from library
- [ ] Verify it makes sense in context

### **Phase 4: Validation (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Read through edited sections
- [ ] Check: Does each example use JTBD language?
- [ ] Check: Is the altitude appropriate?
- [ ] Check: Does it reflect actual curriculum?
- [ ] Check: Would Trevor say "yes, that's what we teach"?

## 📝 REPLACEMENT LIBRARY STARTER

### **Students (Level 1-2)**

**Concrete Problem Recognition:**
```
✅ "Sometimes AI works. Sometimes it doesn't. You don't know why."
✅ "Everyone acts like this stuff is obvious. You feel confused."
✅ "You're afraid to ask because everyone else seems to get it."
```

**Concrete Transformation:**
```
✅ "By Week 4: You'll know WHY it worked and WHY it failed."
✅ "Learn the mental models for WHEN to use AI vs. when to think on your own."
✅ "Stop feeling behind. Learn what Nairobi kids already know."
```

**Social Proof (their altitude):**
```
✅ "Join 200 students who won't feel behind at university."
✅ "You're not the only one who feels confused. 75% of students do."
```

---

### **Parents (Level 2-3)**

**Proof/Results Focus:**
```
✅ "By Week 4, you'll see them demonstrate skills they couldn't do before."
✅ "92% completion rate vs. 5% for typical online courses."
