when intelligence becomes amplifiable. That's what we teach."

WITH AI—she knows why it works, when to use it, how to steer it.
That's the difference."

**New Facilitator Training Module:**
```markdown
## Embodying "Thinking with AI"

As a facilitator, your language matters. Students pick up on
subtle cues. Here's how to embody the core concept:

✅ SAY:
- "How were you THINKING about this problem?"
- "What made you decide to use AI here?"
- "Notice how your thinking shifted?"

❌ DON'T SAY:
- "Here's the right prompt to use"
- "Just copy this template"
- "AI will do it for you"

The difference: We're teaching THINKING, not tool usage.
```

## Quick Reference: "Thinking with AI" Across Contexts

### For Strategic Documents
**Use:** Full philosophical framing
> "We're teaching students to think in the age of democratized intelligence—to integrate AI into their cognitive process as an extension of consciousness."

### For Conversion Copy (Parents/Principals)
**Use:** Framework-level clarity
> "Students learn to think WITH AI, not just copy FROM it. They build mental models for when and how to integrate AI strategically."

### For Student-Facing Copy
**Use:** Concrete, immediate benefits
> "Stop feeling confused when you use AI. Learn why it works sometimes and fails other times. Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers thrive."

### For Facilitators
**Use:** Embodiment language
> "Every time you say 'prompt,' you're teaching tool usage. Every time you ask 'how were you thinking about this?', you're teaching thinking with AI."

## Integration Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure "thinking with AI" is properly integrated:

### ✅ Strategic Alignment
- [ ] Does this document reference the core concept?
- [ ] Is the Cartographer/Territory Map shown as pedagogy, not brand?
- [ ] Is "thinking with AI" positioned as the organizing principle?

### ✅ Linguistic Consistency
- [ ] Does copy use "thinking" language vs. "tool" language?
- [ ] Are we saying "think WITH AI" not "use AI tools"?
- [ ] Is the altitude appropriate for the audience?

### ✅ Differentiation Clarity
- [ ] Is it clear how we're different from "AI tools courses"?
- [ ] Is the "era shift" framing present?
- [ ] Do we emphasize cognitive transformation over skill acquisition?

### ✅ Philosophical Coherence
- [ ] Does this ladder back to democratized intelligence?
- [ ] Is second-order thinking evident (teaching HOW to think)?
- [ ] Is the pedagogy (Cartographer) aligned with the brand (Thinking with AI)?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

When updating documents, watch for these red flags:

❌ **"Learn AI tools"** → ✅ "Learn to think with AI"
❌ **"Master ChatGPT"** → ✅ "Build thinking habits for the AI age"
❌ **"AI skills course"** → ✅ "Cognitive transformation program"
❌ **"Prompt engineering"** → ✅ "Mental models for AI integration"
❌ **"We teach you to use AI"** → ✅ "We teach you to think differently when intelligence is democratized"

---

## Success Criteria

**You'll know the cascade is complete when:**

1. ✅ Every document references "thinking with AI" appropriately for its audience
2. ✅ Copy at all altitudes (1-5) maintains philosophical coherence
3. ✅ The differentiation is crystal clear: Thinking vs. Using
4. ✅ Facilitators can articulate the core concept in their own words
5. ✅ Users can repeat back "K2M teaches thinking with AI, not just using tools"
6. ✅ The Cartographer/Territory Map is positioned as pedagogy, not brand
7. ✅ All conversion copy ladders back to the core concept

---
