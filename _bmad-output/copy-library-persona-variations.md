# K2M Copy Library: Persona Variations

**Ready-to-Use Copy Across Personas × JTBD × Platforms**

*"Same mission. Different doors. Each persona gets language at their altitude."*

---

## 📋 HOW TO USE THIS LIBRARY

Each copy example includes:
- **Persona**: Who it's for
- **JTBD**: Which job it addresses
- **Altitude**: Linguistic abstraction level (1-5)
- **Temperature**: Cold/Warm/Hot audience
- **Platform**: Where to use it
- **Modules Used**: Which framework layers were applied

**Pick the copy that matches your audience + goal.**

# 🎓 STUDENT PERSONA COPY

## Student Copy #1: Cold Awareness (LinkedIn/Instagram)

**Persona**: Student (gap year, anxious)
**JTBD**: "Stop feeling like everyone else already knows"
**Altitude**: Level 1 (Concrete)
**Temperature**: Cold
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok
**Modules**: Layer -1 (Student 1-2) + Layer 1A (Manifesto) + Layer 2 (Gear 3)

---

### The Hook

```
Sometimes AI works.
Sometimes it doesn't.
You don't know why.
```

### Body Copy

```
You've done it. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, submit assignment.

It feels productive. But here's the problem:

You're not learning. You're copy-pasting your way through school.

And when internships start? When professors ask follow-up questions?

You're stuck.

Everyone acts like this tech stuff is obvious. If you admit you're
struggling, people look at you like you're behind.

But here's the truth:

You're not the only one who doesn't know.

The students who thrive? They built something different: invisible
writing muscles—the ability to think clearly without looking at notes.

They don't copy-paste. They think.

The habits you form now follow you forever.

Which ones are you building?
```

### CTA (Soft - No CTA for cold awareness)

```
[No CTA - pure value drop]

Or add soft awareness:
"More on how this works tomorrow."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Level 1 language (concrete: "Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V")
- Addresses primary JTBD (anxiety, "everyone else knows")
- Creates "I can't unsee this" recognition
- No pressure (70-30 rule: this is the 70%)

---

## Student Copy #2: Warm Consideration (LinkedIn Post)

**Persona**: Student (engaged with you before)
**JTBD**: "Have proof I'm prepared"
**Altitude**: Level 2 (Pattern)
**Temperature**: Warm
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Newsletter
**Modules**: Layer -1 (Student 1-2) + Layer 1A (Method) + Layer 2 (Gears 1, 2, 3)

---

### The Hook

```
Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers get hired.

Here's the difference.
```

### Body Copy

```
Last week, I talked about invisible writing muscles—the ability to
think without external support.

A lot of you asked: "How do I build that?"

Here's the truth most AI courses won't tell you:

You don't build it by watching videos.
You don't build it by reading articles.
You build it by DOING—with feedback, with peers, with repetition.

Here's what that looks like:

Week 1: You copy-paste a prompt → AI gives generic answer
Week 3: You iterate 5 times → AI gives useful answer
Week 6: You know what to ask WITHOUT looking at examples

That's the shift. From dependency to capability.

The K2M spring cohort does this with 200 students learning together.

Not alone. Not watching videos you'll abandon.

Together. Daily practice. Real accountability.

By Week 6, you'll have:
✅ A project you can show employers
✅ The ability to use AI without copy-pasting
✅ Confidence to participate in AI conversations (not stay quiet)

Curious if you're a copy-paster or thinker?

### CTA (Micro-Commitment)

```

No email required. See your results instantly.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Level 2 language (pattern: "copy-pasters get stuck")
- Addresses secondary JTBD (proof, capability)
- Gear 1 (micro-commitment: quiz)
- Gear 2 (sample before commit)
- Warm audience = ready for soft CTA

## Student Copy #3: Hot Conversion (Email/Landing Page)

**Persona**: Student (completed quiz, ready to decide)
**JTBD**: "Stop feeling anxious AND have proof"
**Altitude**: Level 1-2 (Concrete → Pattern)
**Temperature**: Hot
**Platform**: Email, Landing Page Hero
**Modules**: Layer -1 (Student 1-2) + Layer 1A (Conversion) + Layer 2 (ALL 5 Gears)

---

### The Hook (Level 1 - Concrete)

```
Walk into university ready—
not wondering if everyone else already knows.
```

### The Problem (Gear 3 - Recognition)

```
You show up to university. Day one. You're excited, nervous, ready.

Then someone mentions ChatGPT. Or machine learning. Or "I've been
coding since Form 2."

And suddenly you realize: everyone else already knows things you don't.

You spend the next semester pretending to understand. Nodding along
in lectures. Going home and stressing. Watching YouTube videos at
2am trying to catch up.

It doesn't have to be that way.
```

### The Solution (Gear 2 - Entry + Gear 4 - Visual Hierarchy)

```
🎯 THE K2M SPRING COHORT

6 weeks of learning AI with 200 students who are starting from
the same place you are.

No one expects you to know anything.
You won't be the only one asking "basic" questions.
And by the time university starts, you'll walk in knowing what
everyone else knows—maybe more.

───────────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:

✅ How to use AI for your actual coursework (not just copy-pasting)
✅ How to explain your situation so AI gives useful answers
✅ The 4 habits that separate students who use AI well from those
   who don't

───────────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT YOU'LL GET:

📚 6 weeks of structured learning with daily practice
👥 A community of 200 students going through the same thing
🎨 A project you can show employers and universities
💪 The confidence to participate in AI conversations (not stay quiet)
```

### The Urgency (Gear 5 - Mental Timeline)

```
⏰ THE NEXT COHORT STARTS FEBRUARY 14

University starts soon after. Do the math.

Every week you wait = 3 students building habits you're delaying.

The habits you form now follow you forever.
Start the right ones today.
```

### The Investment

```
💰 3,500 KES

That's less than one night out.
Less than a textbook you'll never read.
Less than the stress of feeling behind for four years.
```

### The CTA (Strong - Hot Audience)

💬 WHAT STUDENTS SAY:

"I was so worried about university. Everyone in my family kept asking
if I was ready, and I kept saying yes while feeling no. After K2M,
I actually feel ready."
— Amara K., UoN Computer Science

"I tried learning AI on YouTube. Gave up after 3 days. K2M was different
because I wasn't alone. When I got stuck, there were 200 other students
asking the same questions."
— Joseph M., Moi University Business Admin

📊 RESULTS:

• 92% completion rate (vs. 5% for typical online courses)

- ALL 5 Gears engaged (Friction, Entry, Cognitive Load, Visual Hierarchy, Timeline)
- Addresses MULTIPLE JTBD (anxiety + proof + belonging)
- Level 1-2 language throughout
- Strong urgency (but authentic: real cohort start date)
- Hot audience = ready for direct ask

**JTBD**: "Stop wasting money on programs my child quits"
**Altitude**: Level 2 (Pattern recognition)
**Temperature**: Cold
**Platform**: Facebook Groups, Community Forums
**Modules**: Layer -1 (Parent 2-3) + Layer 1A (Method) + Layer 3 (Ethics)

---

### The Hook

```
Have you paid for a program your child quit after 2 days?

You're not alone.
```

### Body Copy

```
Last month, I paid 15,000 shillings for a coding bootcamp for my daughter.

She went to two sessions. Then said the instructor was "too fast" and
she felt lost.

15,000 shillings gone.

I talked to other parents. Same story:

"Paid for online course—never finished it."
"Bought expensive laptop—became a YouTube machine."
"Enrolled in tech camp—quit after one week."

We're all trying to prepare our children for AI and technology.
But everything we pay for gets abandoned.

Here's what I learned:

The problem isn't the content. It's the isolation.

When a student is alone watching videos, they quit the moment it gets hard.

But when 200 students are learning TOGETHER—when your child sees
others showing up—they show up too.

That's what K2M does differently.

Not another video course to abandon.
A cohort of 200 students with daily practice and real accountability.

92% completion rate. Not 5%. Ninety-two percent.

That's what happens when students aren't learning alone.

I'm sharing this because I know many of you are facing the same worry:

"How do I prepare my child for university when I don't even understand
AI myself?"

This might be the answer.

K2M Spring Cohort: 6 weeks, 3,500 KES, starts February 14.

Here's the information: [Link]
```

### CTA (Soft - Community Share)

```
Has anyone else tried this? I'd love to hear experiences before
enrolling my daughter.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Level 2 language (pattern: "this is what happened to us")
- Addresses primary JTBD (waste prevention)
- Vulnerable authority (parent-to-parent, not expert-to-audience)
- No hard sell (70-30 rule: giving, not asking)
- Cold audience = building trust first

### Subject Line

```
You asked how K2M is different from programs your child quits
```

### Email Body

```
Hi [Parent Name],

You visited the K2M page yesterday. I'm guessing you're asking the
same question every parent asks:

"Will my child actually finish this?"

Fair question. You've been burned before.

Here's what makes K2M different:

──────────────────────────────────────────

THE COHORT STRUCTURE

When your child is alone watching videos, they quit the moment it
gets hard. No one is waiting for them. No one notices they're gone.

K2M: 200 students learning together.

When your child sees others showing up to practice sessions, asking
questions, completing exercises—they show up too.

That's why the completion rate is 92% (not 5% like typical online courses).

──────────────────────────────────────────

VISIBLE PROOF

By Week 6, you'll see tangible evidence:

✅ Your child will demonstrate what they learned (not just talk about it)
✅ You'll watch them use AI to solve a problem without copy-pasting
✅ They'll have a project to show employers and professors

Not a certificate. Actual capability you can observe.

──────────────────────────────────────────

THE INVESTMENT

3,500 KES for 6 weeks.

Compare that to:
• The 15K bootcamp they quit after 2 sessions
• The 60K laptop that became a video player
• Four years of university feeling behind

──────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT OTHER PARENTS SAY:

"I don't understand AI myself, but I can see my son understands it now.
He explains things to me. That's proof enough."
— Mrs. Kimani, Parent of Amara (UoN Computer Science)

"Every shilling I spend on education, I wonder if it's wasted. This
one wasn't."
— Mr. Omondi, Parent of Joseph (Moi University Business Admin)

──────────────────────────────────────────

The spring cohort starts February 14.
47 spots remaining (out of 200).

If you have questions, reply to this email. I'm here to help.

Best,
[Your Name]
K2M Team

P.S. If you're still on the fence, consider this:

University starts 6 weeks after our cohort ends. Your child will
either walk in prepared, or they won't.

The only question is whether you act now or wish you had later.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Level 2-3 language (pattern → framework)
- Addresses primary JTBD (proof, waste prevention)
- Trust signals (completion rate, parent testimonials)
- Warm audience = ready for medium urgency
- Authentic urgency (real cohort date, not manufactured)

Dear mothers,

I wanted to share something that's been on my mind.

Many of us are worried about preparing our children for university—
especially with all this AI technology we don't understand ourselves.

I found a program called K2M: 200 students learn AI together for
6 weeks before university starts.

What makes it different:

✅ Cohort structure (students don't quit because they're learning together)
✅ 92% completion rate (not 5% like online courses we've paid for before)
✅ Visible results (you'll see your child demonstrate what they learned)
✅ 3,500 KES for 6 weeks (less than bootcamps that get abandoned)

My daughter is signed up for the February cohort. Thought I'd share
in case others are interested.

Spring cohort starts Feb 14. They're taking 200 students.

Here's the information: [Link]

If anyone has questions, I'm happy to share what I've learned.

— [Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Level 2-3 language (proof-oriented)
- Addresses multiple JTBD (waste, proof, belonging)
- Peer recommendation (parent-to-parent trust)
- Clear value proposition
- Hot audience = direct CTA acceptable

YOU LIE AWAKE WONDERING IF THEY'RE READY

You've done everything you can. School fees. Textbooks.
Maybe extra tutoring.

But the world they're entering isn't the one you knew.

AI is changing everything. Every article says so. Your colleagues
mention it. Your relatives ask about it.

And you're not sure your child is prepared.

──────────────────────────────────────────

YOU'RE NOT ALONE

70% of Kenyan parents share this worry. You want to help, but you
don't fully understand AI yourself.

And everything you've paid for gets abandoned:
❌ The 15K bootcamp they quit after 2 sessions
❌ The online course they never finished
❌ The laptop that became a YouTube machine

──────────────────────────────────────────

K2M IS DIFFERENT

6 weeks. 200 students. Learning together before university starts.

✅ COHORT STRUCTURE
   Students don't quit because they're learning together
   92% completion rate (vs. 5% for typical online courses)

✅ VISIBLE PROOF
   By Week 6, you'll see tangible results
   Not a certificate—actual capability you can observe

✅ DESIGNED FOR NON-TECHNICAL STUDENTS
   Your child doesn't need to be a "tech person"
   They just need to be willing to learn

✅ AFFORDABLE
   3,500 KES for 6 weeks
   Less than programs that get abandoned

──────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT OTHER PARENTS SAY:

"I paid 15,000 for a coding bootcamp. She quit after 2 sessions.
K2M was 3,500 and she finished the whole thing. The difference was
the community—she didn't want to fall behind the other students."
— Mrs. Kimani, Mother of Amara (UoN CS)

"I don't understand AI myself, but I can see my son understands it
now. He explains things to me. That's proof enough."

Re: Parents asking "Do you teach AI?"
```

### Email Body

```
Dear [Principal Name],

I know you're getting this question at every admissions tour:

"Do you teach AI? Are students prepared for technology?"

Other schools in [City] have robotics labs, coding clubs, STEM programs.

Whether those actually work is beside the point—they look modern.

What do you have to show?

──────────────────────────────────────────

15 SCHOOLS ARE USING K2M

K2M gives you a credible answer without the headache of building
something from scratch.

How it works:

1. You identify Form 4 graduates interested in AI preparation
2. We run the 6-week cohort (curriculum, facilitation, tracking)
3. You get completion data and testimonials for admissions materials

What you can tell parents:

"Our students learn AI before university through the K2M program.
Last year, 92% of participants completed the full 6 weeks and
demonstrated practical AI skills."

──────────────────────────────────────────

PROOF BEFORE COMMITMENT

We know you've been burned before. The STEM vendor who came twice
and disappeared. The coding program nobody used.

That's why we offer pilot programs:

• 10 students from your school
• 6 weeks, fully managed
• You observe the entire process
• See results before scaling

──────────────────────────────────────────

Would a 15-minute call make sense to discuss a pilot?

I'm available [Date/Time Options].

**Why This Works:**
- Level 3 language (framework, system)
- Addresses primary JTBD (competitive positioning)
- Acknowledges vendor burnout (builds trust)
- Low-risk entry (pilot before commitment)
- Cold audience = educational, not salesy

```

### Email Body

```
Dear [Principal Name],

Thank you for the conversation yesterday. As discussed, here's the
pilot proposal for [School Name].

──────────────────────────────────────────

PILOT STRUCTURE

Cohort Size: 10 students (Form 4 graduates preparing for university)
Duration: 6 weeks (Feb 14 - Mar 28)
Investment: [Pilot Price] (vs. [Full Price] for standard school partnership)

What we provide:
✅ Full curriculum + facilitation
✅ Daily practice sessions (30 min/day)
✅ Weekly progress reports to school administration
✅ Completion certificates + demonstrated project portfolios
✅ Post-cohort testimonials for your admissions materials

What you provide:
✅ Student recruitment (we provide enrollment materials)
✅ School endorsement (optional co-branding)

──────────────────────────────────────────

SUCCESS METRICS

You mentioned wanting data for your board. Here's what we track:

• Completion rate (target: >90%)
• Student confidence pre/post (1-10 scale)
• Parent satisfaction (post-cohort survey)
• Demonstrated capability (project evaluation)

After the pilot, you'll have:
1. Completion data to show your board
2. Student testimonials for admissions tours
3. Parent feedback for validation
4. Clear decision on whether to scale to full graduating class

──────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT OTHER SCHOOLS SAY:

"We were skeptical. Every vendor promises 'transformation.' K2M
actually delivered—10 students completed, parents were happy, and
now we're running it for our full graduating class."
— Mr. Kibet, Principal, [School Name], Nairobi

"I can finally answer parents when they ask 'Do you teach AI?'
The data backs it up: 92% completion, visible results."
— Mr. Otieno, Principal, [School Name], Nairobi suburbs

──────────────────────────────────────────

NEXT STEPS

To move forward with the pilot:

1. Identify 10 interested students (we can help with recruitment copy)
2. Sign pilot agreement (attached)
3. We'll handle everything else

Spring cohort starts Feb 14. If you'd like to participate, we'd need

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS

**To adapt any copy:**

1. **Keep the altitude** (don't go higher than the persona needs)
2. **Keep the JTBD focus** (don't try to address all jobs in one piece)
3. **Adjust specific details** (dates, prices, names)
4. **Test the "I can't unsee it" criterion** (does it create recognition?)
