# 12. MEASUREMENT & REPORTING

## WHAT WE MEASURE (NOT GRADES)

**We DON'T Measure:**
- Test scores
- Quiz accuracy
- Prompt quality
- Artifact ratings
- Speed of completion

**We DO Measure:**

**1. Language Shifts**
- **Before:** "AI gave me" → **After:** "I explained and got"
- **Before:** "I hope this works" → **After:** "I can make this work"
- **Before:** "What's the right prompt?" → **After:** "Let me think about this differently"

**2. Agency Indicators**
- Where student places responsibility (AI vs. self)
- How they explain failure (bad AI vs. missing context)
- Whether they iterate (one-and-done vs. refinement)

**3. Engagement Signals**
- Attendance at live sessions
- Practice completion rate
- Reflection depth (not quality)
- Peer acknowledgment given

**4. Confidence Statements**
- "I feel more confident using AI"
- "I understand why things work now"
- "I'm not afraid to use AI"

## WEEKLY CHECK-IN METRICS

**For Each Student:**
- [ ] Attended live session?
- [ ] Submitted practice?
- [ ] Posted reflection?
- [ ] Interacted in cluster?

**Red Flags (Intervention Needed):**
- 3+ days silent in Discord
- No practice submissions 2 weeks running
- Expressions of overwhelm or frustration
- Drop in engagement

## PROGRESSION SIGNALS

**Zone 0 → Zone 1 (Week 1):**
- Student asks first question
- Reports "it responded to me"
- Shift from watching to participation

**Zone 1 → Zone 2 (Week 1-2):**
- Explains context in prompts
- Notices output changes
- Shifts from "it's random" to "I see patterns"

**Zone 2 → Zone 3 (Week 2-3):**
- Has multi-turn conversations
- Uses AI for thinking, not just answers
- Shifts from "tasks" to "collaboration"

**Zone 3 → Zone 4 (Week 4-6):**
- Iterates deliberately
- Edits their own work with AI
- Shifts from "it helps" to "I direct"

## SHIFT VERIFICATION QUESTIONS ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Foundational Alignment:** From AI Curriculum Framework, Part 6 (Assessment System)

These questions are NOT for grading. They're for detecting perceptual shifts.

**How to Use:**
- Facilitators ask these questions during weekly check-ins (Week 1, 2, 3, 6)
- Listen for zone-indicative language (not right/wrong answers)
- Record student's zone progression in tracking sheet

---

### ZONE 0→1 VERIFICATION (Week 1 Check-In)

**The Shift:** "AI is not for me" → "AI is something I could use"

**Verification Question:**
> "What would you want to try with AI?"

**Listen For:**

| Not Shifted (Zone 0) | Shifted (Zone 1) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| "I don't know" / "Nothing" | Has specific ideas |
| "AI is for other people" | "I should try that" |
| Dismissive, distant | Curious, interested |
| "I'm not technical" | "I could learn this" |

**Language Shifts to Notice:**
- Before: "That AI stuff" / "Not for me"
- After: "I could use AI for..." / "I want to try..."

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Zone 0 students need permission to experiment
- Create safe, low-stakes opportunities (no judgment)
- Normalize "I tried and it was weird" experiences

---

### ZONE 1→2 VERIFICATION (Week 1-2 Check-In)

**The Shift:** "AI is interesting" → "AI does real work for me"

**Verification Question:**
> "Tell me about the last time AI helped you with something."

**Listen For:**

| Not Shifted (Zone 1) | Shifted (Zone 2) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Vague or no example | Specific recent example |
| "I should try..." | "I used it for..." |
| Experimental use | Regular use for real tasks |
| Skeptical of output | Trusts (with verification) |

**Language Shifts to Notice:**
- Before: "I should try..." / "It's interesting"
- After: "I used it for..." / "It helped me with..."

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Zone 1→2 shift happens when AI becomes practical (not novel)
- Look for "real task" examples (email, homework, planning)
- Integration into workflow is the signal

---

### ZONE 2→3 VERIFICATION (Week 2-3 Check-In)

**The Shift:** "AI does tasks" → "AI understands my intent"

**Verification Question:**
> "Walk me through how you'd use AI for [complex task like planning your semester]."

**Listen For:**

| Not Shifted (Zone 2) | Shifted (Zone 3) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| "I'd ask it to [simple command]" | "I'd first explain..." |
| One-shot usage | Multi-turn refinement |
| "AI didn't understand" | "I need to explain better" |
| Task execution | Thinking partnership |

**Language Shifts to Notice:**
- Before: "I'd ask ChatGPT to..."
- After: "I'd explain my situation, then we'd work through..."

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Zone 2→3 shift is about conversation, not commands
- Look for multi-turn conversations (back-and-forth)
- Students notice "AI gets me when I explain more"

---

### ZONE 3→4 VERIFICATION (Week 6 Check-In)

**The Shift:** "AI understands me" → "I control the quality"

**Verification Question:**
> "How do you know when AI output is done? When do you stop iterating?"

**Listen For:**

| Not Shifted (Zone 3) | Shifted (Zone 4) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| "When it makes sense" | "When it meets my criteria" |
| "When it's good enough" | "When I've shaped it to be excellent" |
| Waits for AI to get it right | Actively directs quality |
| Accepts first-draft output | Iterates deliberately |

**Language Shifts to Notice:**
- Before: "AI gave me this" / "It looks good"
- After: "I made this with AI" / "I refined it until..."

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Zone 3→4 shift is about ownership, not collaboration
- Look for deliberate iteration (5+ turns on same output)
- Students say "I directed this" not "AI gave me this"

---

## WEEKLY FACILITATOR CHECK-IN SCRIPTS

**Week 1 Check-In (After Session):**
```
"Quick check-in question:

What would you want to try with AI that you haven't tried yet?

(Just 1-2 lines. No wrong answers.)"
```

**Week 2 Check-In (After Session):**
```
"Quick check-in question:

Think about the last time AI helped you with something real.
What was it?

(One sentence is fine.)"
```

**Week 3 Check-In (After Session):**
```
"Quick check-in question:

You've used AI a few times now. What feels different about
how you approach it compared to Week 1?

(2-3 lines max.)"
```

**Week 6 Check-In (Before Artifact):**
```
"Quick reflection before you create your artifact:

How do you know when AI output is done? When do you stop
working on it?

(This will help you with your artifact.)"
```
