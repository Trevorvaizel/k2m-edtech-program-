## DAILY POST TEMPLATES

**PHASE 1: NORMALIZATION (Days 1-7)**

**Day 1:**
```
Hook: "If AI feels powerful but inconsistent, you're not alone."

Body: "Most people use AI sometimes, but they don't feel
in control of when it works and when it doesn't.

The problem isn't you. The problem is that nobody
taught you how to actually work with it."

CTA: "We're running a 6-week cohort that fixes this.
Starting Feb 14. 200 seats only."
```

**Day 2:**
```
Hook: "Most students don't talk about this openly."

Body: "Behind the scenes, lots of people feel:
- Confused why AI works sometimes
- Dependent on copying prompts
- Unsure if they're 'doing it right'

That's normal. You're not behind."

CTA: "Join 200 other students feeling the same way.
Cohort starts Feb 14. Link in bio."
```

**Day 3:**
```
Hook: "AI isn't hard. It's just badly explained."

Body: "Most AI training teaches tools.
We teach orientation.

The difference:
Tools expire quickly.
Orientation lasts forever."

CTA: "Get oriented before university starts.
Feb 14 cohort. 3,500 KES. Apply now."
```

**Day 4:**
```
Hook: "You're already using AI — but are you using it well?"

Body: "Signs you're ready for this cohort:
- You try prompts and get mixed results
- You copy examples hoping they'll work
- You feel like everyone else 'gets it' except you

Time to stop guessing. Start understanding."
```

**Day 5:**
```
Hook: "Why we DON'T teach prompts."

Body: "Because prompts change.
Tools change.
Models change.

We teach HOW TO THINK about AI.
That transfers everywhere."
```

**Day 6:**
```
Hook: "6 weeks. 200 students. One goal."

Body: "By the time you start university:
✓ You'll understand why AI works sometimes
✓ You'll have a reliable way to use it
✓ You'll feel confident, not confused

That's the promise."
```

**Day 7:**
```
Hook: "The habits you form now will follow you into university."

Body: "Bad habits:
- Guessing at prompts
- Copying without understanding
- Hoping for the best

Good habits:
- Explaining clearly
- Thinking before asking
- Noticing what works

Which ones do you want?"
```

**PHASE 2: REFRAME + CLARITY (Days 8-14)**

**Day 8:**
```
Hook: "We don't teach AI. We teach confidence."

Body: "Here's what changes:
Before: "I hope this works"
After: "I know how to make this work"

That's what 6 weeks does."
```

**Day 9:**
```
Hook: "Why we cap cohorts at 200."

Body: "Because:
- Practice quality matters
- Small groups feel safe
- Facilitators can actually support
- Nobody gets lost in the crowd

200 seats. Feb 14 cohort."
```

**Day 10:**
```
Hook: "What parents need to know."

Body: "This isn't tech training.
It's thinking practice.

Students learn:
- Clarity, not shortcuts
- Confidence, not dependency
- Habits that transfer to university

3,500 KES. Small commitment. Serious preparation."
```

**Day 11:**
```
Hook: "Week 1 you'll feel the difference."

Body: "Not 'you'll learn new tools.'
You'll feel: 'Oh, now I get why this works.'

That shift in Week 1 changes everything."
```

**Day 12:**
```
Hook: "Who this is for."

Body:
✓ Students entering university soon
✓ People using AI but feeling inconsistent results
✓ Anyone tired of copying prompts
✓ Those who want confidence, not hacks

Who this is NOT for:
✗ People wanting technical certificates
✗ Those seeking 'advanced' prompt engineering
✗ Anyone looking for shortcuts"

```

**Day 13:**
```
Hook: "University is coming. AI isn't waiting."

Body: "The students who show up prepared:
- Don't feel behind
- Ask better questions
- Think more clearly
- Use AI intentionally

That's an advantage."
```

**Day 14:**
```
Hook: "Last week to join Feb 14 cohort."

Body: "200 seats.
Feb 14 start.
6 weeks to confidence.

If you've been waiting for the right time —
this is it."
```
