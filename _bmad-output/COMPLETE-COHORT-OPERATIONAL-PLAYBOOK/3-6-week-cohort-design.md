# 3. 6-WEEK COHORT DESIGN

## COHORT PARAMETERS
- **Duration:** 6 weeks
- **Start Date:** Feb 14, 2026
- **Students:** 200 total
- **Clusters:** 8 clusters × 25 students each
- **Price:** 3,500 KES (~$27 USD)
- **Platform:** Discord
- **Target:** Post-high school → pre-university students (Kenya)
- **Revenue:** 700,000 KES per cohort

## WEEK-BY-WEEK PROGRESSION

| Week | Zone Shift | Public Promise | Student Feels | Habit Installed |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0→2 | "AI will feel less random" | "I can use this" | Pause before asking |
| 2 | 2→3 | "You'll understand why AI works sometimes" | "I see patterns" | Explain context |
| 3 | 3 | "You'll use AI to think, not just answer" | "This is a thinking partner" | Use before decisions |
| 4 | 3→4 | "You'll improve quality deliberately" | "I can make this better" | Change one thing |
| 5 | Early 4 | "You'll notice your own shift" | "I've changed" | Recognition |
| 6 | Early 4 | "You'll have proof of your new approach" | "I'm ready for uni" | All habits stabilized |

## ⚠️ JOURNEY COMPRESSION NOTE

**What This Cohort Combines:**

This 6-week cohort combines TWO journeys from the AI Curriculum Framework:
- **Journey A:** Zone 0 → 2 (typically 2-4 weeks)
- **Journey B:** Zone 2 → 4 (typically 6-8 weeks)

**Standard Timeline:** 8-12 weeks total
**Our Timeline:** 6 weeks (accelerated)

**Why This Compression Works:**
1. **Intensive Facilitation:** 8 moderators for 200 students (1:25 ratio) creates high-touch support
2. **Daily Practice:** 15-20 min/day maintains momentum between sessions
3. **Cohort Momentum:** 200 students learning together creates accelerated growth

**Risks We're Managing:**
- **Integration Time:** Foundation says "Rushing creates unstable shifts." We address this through:
  - Week 4-6 are explicitly "consolidation weeks" (no new content)
  - Daily practice allows gradual integration, not cramming
  - Reflection prompts stabilize learning

- **Overwhelm Risk:** Week 1 combines Zone 0→1 AND Zone 1→2 shifts (ambitious). We manage this by:
  - Facilitators monitor for overwhelm signals
  - Week 1 session is 90 minutes (not rushed)
  - Diagnostic identifies students who may need extra support

- **Quality Maintenance:** Faster pace = quality risk. We maintain quality through:
  - Pre-cohort diagnostic (SOP 0) ensures we meet students where they are
  - Small clusters (25 students) prevent anyone from getting lost
  - Facilitator training emphasizes "notice struggle, don't rescue"

**If Compression Isn't Working:**
If a student is overwhelmed after Week 1-2, facilitators can:
1. Slow them down (focus on current zone, don't push)
2. Offer 1:1 support session
3. Emphasize that Zone 2 is a valid stopping point (Journey A complete)

**Our Commitment:** We prioritize deep learning over speed. If 50% of students reach Zone 4 and 50% reach solid Zone 3, that's better than 100% reaching shaky Zone 4.

## ARTIFACT SYSTEM (WEEK 6)

**Name:** "How I Work With AI Now"

**Format Options:**
1. Screenshot + caption (easiest, most scalable)
2. 60-90 second screen recording
3. Written reflection card (template provided)

**Artifact IS:**
- A marker of identity shift
- Something they're proud of
- Shareable on social media
- Proof for parents

**Artifact is NOT:**
- Graded or assessed
- Compared to others
- A technical project
- Something to be "right" about

**Social Sharing Template:**
```
"I just finished a 6-week AI cohort.
I didn't learn tools — I learned how to think with AI.
This is how I approach it now: [their artifact]

#HowIUseAINow #AIConfidence
