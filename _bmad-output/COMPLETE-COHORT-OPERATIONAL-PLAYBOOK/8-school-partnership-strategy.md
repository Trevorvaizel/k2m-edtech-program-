## SCHOOL OUTREACH MESSAGING

**Email/WhatsApp Script 1: Initial Contact**
```
"Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because your Form 4 leavers might be at a
perfect stage for a program we're running.

We've designed a 6-week AI confidence cohort for students
transitioning to university. It focuses on thinking habits
and clarity — not tools or technical training.

The program:
- Starts February 14 (perfect timing before uni)
- Cohort-based (200 students, small groups)
- Paid externally (no admin burden for the school)
- Designed to reduce anxiety, not add pressure

Would you be open to a one-page summary we could circulate
to interested students/parents?

No pressure — just want to offer this to your community
before the cohort fills.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Phone/WhatsApp]"
```

**Email/WhatsApp Script 2: Follow-Up**
```
"Hi [Name],

Just following up on my message about the university
transition AI cohort.

We're keeping this small (200 students) and cohorts are
already filling.

Would you like me to send:
- A one-pager for students
- A parent information sheet
- An invitation to a brief info session?

Happy to customize based on what would be most useful
for your school.

Let me know,
[Your Name]"
```
