## WEEK 1 SESSION SCRIPT: "WHY AI FEELS CONFUSING"

**0-10 min: Arrival & Framing**
```
"Welcome! This is not a course about AI tools.
It's about how you approach thinking with AI.

Most people think AI is inconsistent.
What you'll discover today is that it's actually very consistent —
just very literal.

You don't need to be 'technical' to be here.
If you can explain something to another human, you already have what you need."
```

**10-25 min: First Contact (Zone 0 → 1)**
```
"Let's start with something very simple.

Ask AI for help with something you actually care about right now.
NOT for school. NOT for productivity.
Just something real in your life.

Examples:
- Help me think about how to spend my break
- Explain something I've always been confused about
- Help me decide between two options

Don't try to be smart. Just ask."
```

[Wait 5 minutes for them to try]

**25-40 min: The Contrast (Zone 1 → 2)**
```
"Now let me show you something.

[Display same task, two ways]

Version A: 'Help me plan my first semester at university'
Version B: 'I'm starting university in February, I'm nervous about managing
my time because I've never lived independently before. Can you help me think
through what I should focus on in my first semester?'

Notice the difference?
Which one feels like it actually understood you?"
```

[Let them respond]

**40-60 min: Guided Redo**
```
"Take the same thing you just asked AI about.
Ask again — but this time, explain it like you're talking to a helpful person.

Include:
- Your situation
- What you're trying to do
- Why it matters to you

Don't optimize. Don't make it clever. Just explain."
```

[Wait 10 minutes]

**60-75 min: Silent Comparison**
```
"Compare your two responses.

Ask yourself:
What changed when you explained more?

Don't share the answer. Just notice it."
```

**75-90 min: Anchor + Close**
```
"Here's what I want you to leave with today:

AI didn't change in the last 90 minutes.
You crossed a threshold.

When AI feels confusing, don't assume it's broken.
Ask: What context am I missing?

This week, you'll practice this on things you actually do.
Not because you have to.
Because once you see this, you can't unsee it.

See you in Discord."
```

## WEEK 1 ASYNC PRACTICE

**Posted in `#daily-practice`:**
```
PRACTICE 1: The Explanations Test

Choose one thing you'll do this week anyway.
Ask AI for help twice:

1. Quickly, without explaining
2. Again, but explain your situation first

Post your reflection (1-2 lines only):
"What changed when you explained more?"

No sharing outputs. No comparing. Just your reflection.
```

---

## WEEK 2 SESSION: "WHY SMALL CHANGES MATTER"

**0-10 min: Normalization**
```
"Last week, AI started feeling less random.

This week, you'll understand WHY it works sometimes —
and why it doesn't other times.

Most people think they're 'bad at AI' when results change.
Today you'll see that you're the variable — and that's good news."
```

**10-30 min: The Small Change Demo**
```
[Show one task, same wording, ONE detail changed]

Same request.
Only difference: who it's for / the goal / the situation.

Notice what changed in the output.
```

**30-50 min: Pattern Recognition**
```
"Here's the rule:

AI doesn't guess what matters.
It uses whatever you give it to decide.

Change one thing → output changes.
That's not inconsistency. That's control."
```

**50-75 min: Individual Practice**
```
"Reuse last week's task.
Change only ONE detail:
- Who is this for?
- What's the goal?
- What's my situation?

Compare the two outputs silently.
Ask: Which change mattered most?
```

**75-90 min: Anchor**
```
"When results change, don't restart.
Change one thing and watch what happens.

This is how bad habits are prevented.
This is how control begins."
```

---

## WEEK 2 ASYNC PRACTICE
```
PRACTICE 2: The One-Thing Test

Take one request you made this week.
Change only ONE detail and observe the result.

Reflection (1-2 lines):
"What detail mattered most?"
```

---

## WEEK 3 SESSION: "AI AS THINKING PARTNER"

**0-15 min: Reframe**
```
"So far, you've learned:
- AI responds when you explain
- Small changes create big differences

This week, you'll use AI differently —
not to get answers, but to think.

AI is not just a tool that gives you things.
It can help you see your own thinking more clearly."
```

**15-35 min: Mirror Demo**
```
[Demonstrate asking AI to:]
- Explain your thinking back to you
- Challenge an assumption
- Simplify something you wrote
- Show you another perspective

Key: AI is responding to thoughts, not replacing them.
```

**35-60 min: Thinking Task**
```
"Choose:
- A decision you're stuck on
- An idea you're developing
- A plan you're making
- Something you're confused about

Ask AI to:
- Clarify it
- Challenge it
- Restructure it
- Show you what you're missing

NO right answers. NO sharing outputs."
```

**60-80 min: Naming**
```
"Notice something:

You weren't asking for answers.
You were asking for perspective.

That's a different relationship with AI."
```

**80-90 min: Anchor**
```
"When you're stuck, AI is most useful BEFORE you decide —
not after.

This is how it becomes a thinking partner.
This is how you stop being alone with hard problems."
```

---

## WEEK 3 ASYNC PRACTICE
```
PRACTICE 3: The Before-Decision Test

Use AI to help you think through something unclear —
NOT to finish it.

Reflection:
"How did it change how I see the problem?"
```

---

## WEEKS 4-6: CONSOLIDATION & ARTIFACT

*(Pattern continues with increasing agency, culminating in Week 6 artifact capture)*

**Week 4:** Quality through iteration ("Make it better")
**Week 5:** Noticing the shift ("How have I changed?")
**Week 6:** Artifact creation + closure ("How I work with AI now")
