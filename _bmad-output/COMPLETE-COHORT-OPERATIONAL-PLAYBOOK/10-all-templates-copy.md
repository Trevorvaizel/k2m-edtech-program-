## PARENT COMMUNICATION TEMPLATE

**Subject: About Your Child's AI Cohort**

```
Dear Parent,

Thank you for supporting [Child's Name] in joining our
6-week AI Confidence Cohort.

I wanted to share what this program actually does —
and what it doesn't.

WHAT WE DO:
We help students develop clear thinking habits when using AI.

WHAT WE DON'T DO:
We don't teach shortcuts, hacks, or dependency.

OUR GOAL:
By the end of 6 weeks, your child will:
- Understand why AI works sometimes and not others
- Have a reliable approach to using AI
- Feel more confident about university
- Avoid bad habits early

OUTCOMES YOU'LL SEE:
- More clarity in how they talk about AI
- Less confusion and anxiety
- Better thinking habits
- A practical artifact they can share (Week 6)

THE COMMITMENT:
- Weekly live sessions (90 minutes)
- Short daily practices (15 minutes)
- 6 weeks total
- 200 students total (kept small for quality)

INVESTMENT:
3,500 KES

This is intentionally priced as a commitment device —
not a profit center.

QUESTIONS?
Just reply to this email. I'm happy to chat.

Looking forward to supporting your child's transition
to university.

Best,
[Your Name]
K2M EdTech
