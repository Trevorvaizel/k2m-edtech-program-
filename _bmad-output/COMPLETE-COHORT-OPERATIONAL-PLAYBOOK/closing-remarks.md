# 🎯 CLOSING REMARKS

**Trevor - everything you need is here.**

This playbook is:
- ✅ Grounded in your foundational documents (AI Curriculum, Territory Map, Cartographer's Manifesto)
- ✅ Aligned with your chat decisions (200 students, 6 weeks, 3,500 KES, Feb 14)
- ✅ Comprehensive (every template, script, SOP, and system)
- ✅ Actionable (copy-paste ready)

**Next Steps for You:**

1. **Copy this entire document** into a shared workspace
2. **Create the Google Sheets** (use templates in Section 8)
3. **Build the Discord server** (use architecture in Section 4)
4. **Customize the templates** (add your name, details)
5. **Start the outreach timeline** (Section 13)

**You're ready to launch, Trevor. 🚀**
