# 4. DELIVERY SYSTEM: DISCORD ARCHITECTURE

## SERVER STRUCTURE (200-STUDENT SAFE)

**🔒 INFORMATION ZONE (READ-ONLY)**
- `#welcome` — Pinned message with program framing + psychological safety statement
- `#how-this-works` — How to use Discord, what to post where
- `#weekly-rhythm` — Weekly intent posts (Mondays, no discussion)
- `#announcements` — Session links, time changes, logistics only

**🧭 COHORT PRACTICE ZONE (CORE LEARNING)**
- `#daily-practice` — Short practice prompts, one post per learner per day (max)
- `#reflections` — 3-5 sentence reflections (emojis allowed, debates NOT allowed)
- `#questions-for-yourself` — Learners post half-formed thoughts, confusion (NO ONE ANSWERS)

**🧩 CLUSTER ZONES (×8)**
Each cluster gets 3 channels only:
- `#cluster-XX-check-ins` — Weekly "I'm here" post (one sentence)
- `#cluster-XX-practice` — Optional sharing (no critique, emoji reactions only)
- `#cluster-XX-support` — Emotional support, logistics (moderator responses ONLY)

**🎓 CLOSURE ZONE (WEEK 6 ONLY)**
- `#how-i-work-with-ai-now` — Artifact posting, celebration reactions only (NO feedback, NO ranking)

## DISCORD RULES (PINNED)

**Learners CAN:**
- Post practices
- Reflect
- Ask themselves questions
- React with emojis

**Learners CANNOT:**
- Critique others
- Give advice
- Optimize prompts
- Debate approaches
- Answer other learners' questions

**Why:** Keeps Zone 3 learners from dominating Zone 0s. Prevents "expert" performance culture.

## ROLES & PERMISSIONS

**Lead Facilitator (You):**
- Full server access
- Posts weekly intent
- Runs live sessions
- Trains moderators

**Moderators (4-5 people):**
- Access to assigned clusters only
- Daily rhythm-keeping (15-20 min/day)
- Post daily practice prompts
- Acknowledge reflections with emojis
- Nudge silent learners privately
- Flag disengagement early

**Moderators NEVER:**
- Explain concepts
- Correct thinking
- Optimize outputs
- "Teach" in Discord

## CLUSTER ASSIGNMENT

**Total:** 200 students
**Clusters:** 8 groups of 25
**Each cluster has:** 1 moderator

**Assignment Logic:** Diagnostic zone + time zone preference

**IMPORTANT:** All students complete SOP 0 (Pre-Cohort Diagnostic) before cluster assignment. This ensures:
- Similar-zone students are grouped together (Zone 0 students together, Zone 1 students together)
- Facilitators know each student's starting barrier type
- Baseline data is captured for progression measurement
