# 7. OUTREACH & ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

## MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

**The Felt Tensions We Name:**
- "I'm using AI but I don't feel in control"
- "Everyone else seems ahead of me"
- "AI works sometimes but not others — I don't know why"
- "I'm falling behind and university is coming"

**The Reframes We Offer:**
- Tension: "AI is overwhelming" → Reframe: "You just need orientation"
- Tension: "I'm behind" → Reframe: "Most people are confused quietly"
- Tension: "I need to learn prompts" → Reframe: "You need habits, not hacks"

**The Primary Promise:**
"By the time you start university, AI won't feel intimidating anymore."

**Parent-Safe Promise:**
"This helps students think clearly with AI — not depend on it."
