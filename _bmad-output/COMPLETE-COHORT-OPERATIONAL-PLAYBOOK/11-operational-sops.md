# 11. OPERATIONAL SOPs

## SOP 0: PRE-COHORT DIAGNOSTIC ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Purpose:** Before any content, know where they are. You cannot design a journey without knowing the starting point.

**When:** After payment confirmed, before Discord invite sent.

**Who Administers:** Facilitator or trained admin (15-20 minutes)

---

### DIAGNOSTIC CONVERSATION GUIDE (15 MINUTES)

**Format:** Video call (Zoom/Google Meet) OR structured Google Form

**Opening (2 minutes):**
```
"Thanks for joining! Before we start the cohort, I want to understand
where you're at with AI so we can support you best.

This isn't a test. There are no right answers. I just want to know
your experience so far.

Everything you share helps us place you in the right cluster
and prepare our facilitators.

Ready?"
```

**Phase 1: Open (2 min)**
```
"Tell me about your experience with AI so far.

Have you used ChatGPT or Claude? What for?
How did it go?
What's your honest feeling about AI right now?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Language patterns (zone indicators below)
- Energy (excitement, fear, confusion)
- Specificity (vague = lower zone)

**Phase 2: Scenario Response (5 min)**
```
"Let me give you a situation.

You need to write an important email for a scholarship application,
or maybe a personal statement for university. You have ChatGPT available.

Walk me through what you'd do."
```

**Their Response Map:**
| Response Pattern | Likely Zone | What It Means |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| "I'd write it myself" | 0-1 | AI not part of their process |
| "I'd ask ChatGPT to write it" | 2 | Delegates task to AI |
| "I'd explain my situation first, then work with ChatGPT" | 3 | Understands collaboration |
| "I'd start with a draft, then iterate with AI to improve it" | 4 | Directs quality intentionally |

**Phase 3: Experience Check (3 min)**

Ask these questions IN ORDER. Where they stop saying "yes" = their zone:

1. "Have you used ChatGPT or Claude at all?"
   - No = Zone 0

2. "Have you used it for actual work or real tasks (not just testing)?"
   - No = Zone 1

3. "Have you had a back-and-forth conversation with AI to refine something?"
   - No = Zone 2

4. "Have you spent 10+ minutes improving one AI output by giving it feedback?"
   - No = Zone 3

5. "Have you created something custom with AI (like a custom GPT or automation)?"
   - No = Zone 4

**Phase 4: Barrier Identification (3 min)**
```
"What's stopped you from going further with AI?

Be honest - what comes up for you?"
```

**Listen for Barrier Types:**
- **Identity:** "I'm not technical" / "I'm not a tech person"
- **Trust:** "Can you trust it?" / "What if it's wrong?"
- **Skill:** "It doesn't understand me" / "I don't know what to ask"
- **Patience:** "Good enough is fine" / "Who has time for that?"
- **Vision:** "I wouldn't know how to build anything"

**Phase 5: Destination (2 min)**
```
"What would you want to be able to do with AI that you can't do now?

What's your goal for the next 6 weeks?"
```

This reveals:
- Motivation
- Expectations
- How far they want to go

   - A. Write it myself
   - B. Ask ChatGPT to write it for me
   - C. Explain my situation, then work with ChatGPT on it
   - D. Start with a draft, then iterate with ChatGPT to improve it

3. **Experience Check:** (Check all that apply)
   - [ ] I've used ChatGPT or Claude
   - [ ] I've used it for real tasks (not just testing)
   - [ ] I've had back-and-forth conversations to refine something
   - [ ] I've spent 10+ minutes improving one AI output
   - [ ] I've created something custom with AI

4. **What's stopped you from going further?** (Text)
   - Be honest: what's held you back?

5. **What's your goal for the next 6 weeks?** (Text)
   - What do you want to be able to do?

**Form Scoring:**
- Checks 0 items = Zone 0
- Checks 1 item = Zone 1
- Checks 2 items = Zone 2
- Checks 3 items = Zone 3
- Checks 4+ items = Zone 4+

### WHY THIS MATTERS (Foundational Alignment)

**From AI Curriculum Framework, Part 2:**
> "Before any content: know where they are. You cannot design a journey
> without knowing the starting point."

**What This Prevents:**
1. **One-Size-Fits-All Teaching:** Zone 0 students need different support than Zone 2 students
2. **Missed Opportunities:** We don't know who needs extra help until it's too late
3. **Poor Placement:** Random cluster assignment mixes zones, creates uneven experiences

**What This Enables:**
1. **Targeted Support:** Facilitators know each student's barrier type upfront
2. **Baseline Data:** We can measure actual zone progression (not just assume it)
3. **Cluster Balance:** Ensure each cluster has similar zone distribution

**Time Investment:** 15-20 min × 200 students = 50-67 hours total
**Value Returned:** Significant. This is the difference between "teaching at them" and "meeting them where they are."

---

### CLUSTER ASSIGNMENT LOGIC (After Diagnostic)

**Principle:** Group similar zones together, but ensure diversity of barrier types.

**Example Cluster (25 students):**
- 15 students at Zone 0-1 (need activation)
- 8 students at Zone 2 (ready for collaboration)
- 2 students at Zone 3 (can model, but not dominate)

**Barrier Type Mix:**
- Identity barriers: ~30%
- Trust barriers: ~25%
- Skill barriers: ~25%
- Other: ~20%

**Why This Mix Works:**
- Zone 0-1 students aren't intimidated by Zone 3 students (only 2)
- Zone 3 students can model without dominating
- Barrier diversity means facilitators see multiple resistance types

**Red Flags (Reassign Student):**
- More than 3 Zone 3 students in one cluster (they'll dominate)
- More than 20 students with same barrier type (facilitator overload)
- Time zone incompatible (can't attend sessions)

## SOP 4: DISCORD MODERATION

**Response Standards:**

**Response Time:**

**What TO Respond To:**
- "How do I use Discord?"
- "I didn't get the message"
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed"
- Technical issues

**What NOT TO Respond To:**
- "Is my prompt good?"
- "Can someone help me improve this?"
- "What's the best way to...?"

**Rule Enforcement:**

**If someone critiques another's output:**
```
"Quick reminder: We share reflections here, but we don't
give feedback or advice. Everyone learns at their own pace.

Emoji reactions are great! Let's keep it supportive, not evaluative."
```

**If someone debates approaches:**
```
"Different approaches work for different people.
We're all here to discover what works for us —
no one 'right way'."
```

We want this to work for you.
If you still want to leave, we respect that.
No hard feelings."
```
