# 2. PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY & GUARDRAILS

## WHAT THIS COHORT ACTUALLY IS

**We are NOT:**
- Teaching AI tools or prompts
- Certifying technical skills
- Creating portfolio projects
- Teaching "advanced" AI systems
- A traditional course

**We ARE:**
- Moving learners through **perceptual zones** (Zone 0 → early Zone 4)
- Installing **durable thinking habits**
- Creating **identity shifts** ("AI is for me" → "I work with AI intentionally")
- Designing for **psychological safety**, not performance
- Building **confidence that transfers** to university and SME contexts

## THE ZONE PROGRESSION (INTERNAL FRAMEWORK)

**Zone 0:** "AI is not for me / it's sci-fi"
→ **Zone 1:** "AI is something I could use"
→ **Zone 2:** "AI does tasks for me"
→ **Zone 3:** "AI understands my intent / I collaborate with it"
→ **Zone 4:** "I control quality / I direct AI"

**Our Target (6 Weeks):** Zone 0 → early Zone 4

## DESIGN GUARDRAILS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**We NEVER:**
- Use technical jargon in Week 1
- Show "impressive" AI outputs (creates intimidation)
- Compare students or rank outputs
- Praise speed or "correctness"
- Talk about "building," "automation," or "systems" (premature for Zone 0-2)
- Evaluate or grade artifacts

**We ALWAYS:**
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Prioritize confidence over competence
- Normalize confusion ("this is normal")
- Use repetition over novelty
- Create psychological safety
- Frame AI as responding to **thinking**, not intelligence

## THE 4 CORE HABITS WE INSTALL

By Week 6, students will have these habits:

1. **Pause before asking** → "What do I actually want?"
2. **Explain context first** → "Here's my situation..."
3. **Change one thing at a time** → "What does this affect?"
4. **Use AI before decisions** → "Help me think, not just answer"

If they keep these habits, the cohort succeeded. Tools change, habits transfer.
