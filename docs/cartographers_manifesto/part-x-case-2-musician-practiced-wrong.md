### Case Study 2: THE MUSICIAN WHO PRACTICED WRONG
**Force 1: Asymmetric Leverage**

**The Story:**
Jazz pianist Bill Evans discovered: Practicing more ≠ getting better.

He realized:
- 80% of jazz harmony comes from 3 chord progressions
- 90% of improvisation comes from 5 rhythmic patterns
- He spent 80% of time practicing the other 20% of material (waste)

He flipped it:
- Spent 80% of time on the 3 core progressions
- Spent 80% of time on the 5 core patterns
- Result: 10x improvement in 6 months

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Asymmetric leverage: 3 concepts = 80% of the field
- Time compression: Dense connections, not more practice
- Attention economics: Strategic allocation on the 20%

**The Universal Lesson:**
Most practice is waste. Find the 3-5 leverage points that drive 80% of results. Master ONLY those first.
