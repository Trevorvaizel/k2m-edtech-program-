### Tool 5: EXPLANATION ACCELERATION
**Learn by Teaching**

**The Process:**
1. Learn something
2. Immediately explain it to a beginner
3. Notice where you can't explain simply
4. Those gaps = what you don't actually understand
5. Go back and learn those gaps

**The Result:**
- "I understood it" vs "I can explain it simply" = massive gap
- Teaching reveals the gaps
- Filling gaps = real understanding

**Richard Feynman's Rule:**
"If you can't explain it to a 6-year-old, you don't understand it."
