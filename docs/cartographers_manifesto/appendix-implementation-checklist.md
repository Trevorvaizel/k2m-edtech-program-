## APPENDIX: IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
### (For Any Field)

Use this to start your journey in any domain.

---

### Step 1: Satellite View Acquisition
- [ ] Identify the 3-5 core concepts of the field
- [ ] Map how they interact (not how they work)
- [ ] Find the 80/20 leverage points
- [ ] Map the boundaries of the field

### Step 2: Leverage Point Selection
- [ ] Identify the 3-5 techniques that drive most results
- [ ] Confirm these align with leverage points
- [ ] Commit to mastering ONLY these first

### Step 3: Constraint Design
- [ ] Design 3 constraints that force focus on leverage points
- [ ] Remove 90% of options/tools
- [ ] Create time pressure

### Step 4: Failure Gradient Planning
- [ ] Plan Tier 1 failures (volume of practice)
- [ ] Plan Tier 2 failures (push methods to breaking)
- [ ] Plan Tier 3 failures (question assumptions)

### Step 5: Context Rotation Strategy
- [ ] Identify 3 different environments to practice in
- [ ] Identify 3 different constraints to rotate
- [ ] Identify 3 different roles to experience

### Step 6: Feedback Loop Acceleration
- [ ] Set up daily micro-experiments (10+ per day)
- [ ] Find a coach/mentor
- [ ] Record yourself for comparison
- [ ] Practice at your edge (where you fail)

### Step 7: Lattice Building
- [ ] After learning each concept, connect it to 3+ existing concepts
- [ ] Map the connections visually
- [ ] Test the connections

### Step 8: Explanation Testing
- [ ] Teach each concept to a beginner
- [ ] Notice where you can't explain simply
- [ ] Learn those gaps

### Step 9: Context Mapping
- [ ] For each rule/technique, map where it works
- [ ] Map where it fails
- [ ] Name the contexts

### Step 10: First Principles Deconstruction
- [ ] Take each technique
- [ ] Ask "why does this exist?"
- [ ] Ask "what problem does it solve?"
- [ ] Ask "is there a better way?"
