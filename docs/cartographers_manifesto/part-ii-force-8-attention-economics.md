### Force 8: ATTENTION ECONOMICS
**Where You Look Is What You Become**

**The Pattern:**
- Your brain has limited attention (conscious processing ~3-7 things at once)
- Where you direct that attention determines what patterns you see
- What patterns you see determines what you learn
- What you learn determines who you become

**The Invisible Trap:**
- Novice attention: Scattered, reactive, pulled by urgency
- Intermediate attention: Focused, but on the wrong things (techniques, not principles)
- Master attention: **Strategic allocation** - 80% on leverage points, 20% on maintenance

**The Force:**
Skill is not about doing more.
Skill is about **paying attention to less** (but the right less).
