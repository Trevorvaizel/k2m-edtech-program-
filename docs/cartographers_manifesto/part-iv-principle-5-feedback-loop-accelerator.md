### Principle 5: THE FEEDBACK LOOP ACCELERATOR
**Compress 10 Years of Experience Into 1 Year**

**The Pattern:**
- Normal: Experience happens → You reflect → You learn (slow)
- Accelerated: You design experiences → You get feedback → You learn (fast)

**The Framework:**

**Loop Speed:**
- Normal feedback loop: Days to weeks
- Accelerated feedback loop: Minutes to hours

**How to Accelerate (Any Field):**

1. **Micro-Experiments**
   - Instead of big projects, do 50 tiny tests
   - Each test = one feedback loop
   - 50 loops in one day = 1 year of experience

2. **Expert Observation**
   - Record yourself performing
   - Compare to masters
   - See what you cannot feel

3. **Immediate Failure**
   - Don't practice what you can do
   - Practice what you CAN'T do
   - Fail immediately, get feedback immediately

4. **Coaching**
   - External eyes see what you cannot
   - Good coach = 10x acceleration

**The Math:**
- Normal: 1 feedback loop per week = 50 loops per year
- Accelerated: 10 feedback loops per day = 3650 loops per year
- Result: **70 years of experience compressed into 1 year**
