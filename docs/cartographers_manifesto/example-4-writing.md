### Example 4: WRITING
**Visible:** The published book
**Mechanics:** Grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure
**Dynamics:** Voice, rhythm, pacing, reader engagement
**Invisible:** Reader psychology, information architecture, emotional resonance, idea synthesis

**Leverage Points:**
- Clear thinking + clear writing = 90% of good writing
- Story structure (conflict, stakes, resolution) = 80% of engagement
- Revision is where writing actually happens

**Time Compression:**
- Master clear thinking (outline first) (1 month)
- Master story structure (3 months)
- Context rotation: genres, lengths, audiences, mediums (6 months)
- Result: 6 months to competent writer vs traditional 5 years
