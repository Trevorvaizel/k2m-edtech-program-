### Example 3: SURGERY
**Visible:** Successful operation
**Mechanics:** Anatomy, procedures, suturing techniques
**Dynamics:** Decision-making under pressure, complication management, patient variability
**Invisible:** Exposure principles, tissue handling, judgment, risk assessment, failure anticipation

**Leverage Points:**
- Exposure + visualization + precision = 90% of surgery
- 10 procedures = 80% of general surgery practice
- Complications follow patterns (bleeding, infection, injury)

**Time Compression:**
- Master exposure principles (3 months)
- Master high-yield procedures (6 months)
- Context rotation: elective vs emergency, different tissue types, complication simulations (1 year)
- Result: 2 years to competent surgeon vs traditional 7-10 years
