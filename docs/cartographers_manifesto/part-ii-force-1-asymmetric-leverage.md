## PART II: THE UNIVERSAL FORCES

### Force 1: ASYMMETRIC LEVERAGE
**The 80/20 Rule That Is Actually 99/1**

In EVERY field, there are a tiny set of actions that drive almost all results.

**Examples (field-agnostic):**
- 3 concepts that explain 90% of the field
- 5 mistakes that cause 95% of failures
- 2 skills that accelerate learning 10x
- 1 perspective shift that transforms understanding

**The Invisible Pattern:**
- Novices spread effort evenly across everything
- Intermediates work harder on more things
- Masters ONLY work on the leverage points
- The force is: **Most activity is waste. Most learning is noise.**
