### Metric 3: CONTEXT ADAPTABILITY
**How many contexts can you operate in?**

**Measurement:**

- Track: Contexts where you've been tested

**Benchmark Progression:**
- Novice: 1 context (where they learned)
- Intermediate: 2-3 contexts
- Advanced: 5+ contexts
- Master: Can enter ANY context and adapt within hours

**What It Measures:**
