### Diagnostic Question 2: CONSTRAINTS
**"What constraints am I working within?"**

- [ ] I have no constraints (playing safe, plateauing)
- [ ] I have imposed constraints (accelerating)
- [ ] I have designed constraints that force leverage point focus (mastering)

**Prescription:**
Add constraints that force you to focus on the 20% that drives 80% of results.
