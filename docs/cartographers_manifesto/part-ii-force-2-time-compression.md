### Force 2: TIME COMPRESSION
**The Non-Linearity of Expertise**

Expertise does NOT accumulate linearly. It compounds in bursts.

**The Pattern:**
- Years 1-2: Linear growth (visible, exciting, deceptive)
- Years 2-5: Plateau (invisible, frustrating, where 90% quit)
- Years 5-10: Exponential jumps (sudden "overnight" mastery)

**The Invisible Mechanism:**
- You're not learning "more"
- You're building **lattice** - a connected network of understanding
- Each new piece of knowledge connects to everything else
- Eventually, the lattice becomes dense enough that learning accelerates
- This is why masters learn in hours what takes novices weeks

**The Force:**
Time is not the input. **Density of connections** is the input.
