### Diagnostic Question 5: EMERGENCE
**"Can I see what happens when elements combine?"**

- [ ] I see techniques individually (Stage 2)
- [ ] I see some interactions (Stage 3)
- [ ] I see emergent properties that none of the techniques have alone (Stage 4+)

**Prescription:**
Combine 3+ techniques and study what emerges that none contain.
