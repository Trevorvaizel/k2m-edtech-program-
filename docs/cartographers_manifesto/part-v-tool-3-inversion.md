### Tool 3: INVERSION
**Learn by Studying Failure**

**The Process:**
1. Instead of "what creates success", ask "what creates failure?"
2. Study every catastrophic mistake in your field
3. Map the failure modes
4. Build avoidance strategies

**Why It Works:**
- Success has many causes (confusing)
- Failure has consistent patterns (clear)
- Studying failure reveals the invisible forces

**The Result:**
You see what experts miss (experts study success).
You gain asymmetric advantage.
