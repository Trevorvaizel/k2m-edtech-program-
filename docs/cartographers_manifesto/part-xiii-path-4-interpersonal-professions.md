### Path 4: INTERPERSONAL PROFESSIONS
**(Teaching, Management, Sales, Leadership)**

**The Satellite View (Weeks 1-2):**
- Core concept 1: Empathy (understanding their reality)
- Core concept 2: Context (what works for this person/situation)
- Core concept 3: Influence (how to create movement)
- Map: All interpersonal success = empathy + context + influence

**Leverage Points:**
- 1 principle: "Meet them where they are" (not where you want them)
- 2 techniques: Listening + questioning (80% of communication)
- 3 constraints: Time, relationship depth, outcome (force clarity)

**Time Compression:**
- Month 1: Practice listening/questioning with 50 people
- Month 3: Context rotation (personalities, situations, cultures)
- Month 6: Leadership (influence at scale)

**Invisible Forces to Watch:**
- Emergence: Group dynamics ≠ individual dynamics (teams are organisms, not collections)
- Context: What works for one person fails with another
- Failure: Most interpersonal failures are assumption failures (you assumed X, they were Y)
