### Diagnostic Question 4: CONTEXT
**"Do I know when my techniques apply?"**

- [ ] I follow rules blindly (Stage 0-1)
- [ ] I know rules work in some situations (Stage 2-3)
- [ ] I can identify the context and choose accordingly (Stage 4-5)
- [ ] I can shift contexts deliberately (Stage 6)

**Prescription:**
Map the contexts where your methods work and fail.
