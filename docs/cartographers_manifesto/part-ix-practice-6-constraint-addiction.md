### Practice 6: THE CONSTRAINT ADDICTION
**Daily Micro-Practice: Love Your Limits**

**The Process:**
**Every day, add ONE constraint:**
- Time constraint: "I have 10 minutes, not 60"
- Tool constraint: "I can only use technique X"
- Environment constraint: "I must practice in a noisy room"
- Outcome constraint: "I must fail at least 5 times"

**The Result:**
- Makes constraints exciting, not scary
- Forces improvisation (which reveals principles)
- Builds "anti-fragility" - you get better under pressure
