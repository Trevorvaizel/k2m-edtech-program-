**Learn How YOU Learn**

**The Process:**
1. Track your learning sessions
2. Notice: When do you learn fastest? Slowest?
3. Notice: What environment works best?
4. Notice: What time of day? What duration?
5. Notice: What techniques work for YOU (not what books say)

**The Result:**
You optimize your personal learning system.
You stop wasting time on ineffective methods.
You accelerate by working WITH your brain, not against it.
