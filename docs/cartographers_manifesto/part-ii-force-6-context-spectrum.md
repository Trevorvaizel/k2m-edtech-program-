### Force 6: THE CONTEXT SPECTRUM
**Why Rules Work Until They Don't**

**The Pattern:**
- Every rule has a context where it applies
- Change the context → The rule breaks
- Experts know the contexts. Novices only know the rules.

**The Spectrum:**
- Level 1: Rule-following (knows WHAT)
- Level 2: Context-aware (knows WHEN)
- Level 3: Context-shifting (knows HOW to change contexts)
- Level 4: Context-creating (invents new contexts)

**The Invisible Force:**
All expertise is **context management** - matching the right approach to the right situation.

The master is not faster. The master is **more precise about context**.
