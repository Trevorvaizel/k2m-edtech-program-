### Case Study 6: THE TEACHER WHO TAUGHT NOTHING
**Force 6: The Context Spectrum**

**The Story:**
Physics teacher Richard Feynman discovered: Explaining technically ≠ teaching.

He found:
- Students who memorized formulas couldn't solve problems
- Students who understood principles (via simple explanations) could solve anything
- Context: Formulas work in textbook problems. Principles work in ANY context.

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Context awareness: Know when formulas apply (and when they don't)
- Satellite view: Principles (Layer 4) before formulas (Layer 2)
- Explanation acceleration: If you can't explain simply, you don't understand

**The Universal Lesson:**
Rules break when context changes. Principles survive all contexts. Teach principles, not rules.
