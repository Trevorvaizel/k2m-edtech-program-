### Integration Strategy 3: THE ANTIFRAGILE PORTFOLIO
**Build Skills That Gain from Disorder**

**The Concept (from Nassim Taleb):**
- Fragile: Breaks under stress (eg. glass)
- Robust: Survives stress (eg. stone)
- Antifragile: GAINS from stress (eg. muscle, immune system)

**The Application:**
Build a skill portfolio that is antifragile:
- Primary field: Your moneymaker (eg. programming)
- Secondary field: Contrarian skill (eg. public speaking)
- Tertiary field: Physical skill (eg. martial arts)

**Why It Works:**
- When one field is stressful, others provide fresh perspective
- Cross-pollination of ideas across fields
- Failures in one field become insights in others

**The Result:**
You become more than the sum of your skills.
You become a **principles-based organism** that learns from everything.
