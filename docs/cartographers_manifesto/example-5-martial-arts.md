### Example 5: MARTIAL ARTS
**Visible:** The match/performance
**Mechanics:** Techniques, forms, conditioning
**Dynamics:** Timing, distance, strategy, adaptation
**Invisible:** Balance, leverage, psychology, efficiency, minimal movement

**Leverage Points:**
- Balance + leverage + timing = 90% of combat effectiveness
- 5 moves cover 80% of situations (jab, cross, clinch, takedown, escape)
- Relaxation is more important than strength

**Time Compression:**
- Master balance + leverage (2 months)
- Master 5 high-yield moves (4 months)
- Context rotation: opponents, rules, environments, pressure (6 months)
- Result: 1 year to competent fighter vs traditional 5 years
