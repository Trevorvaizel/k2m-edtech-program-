### Metric 2: FAILURE VELOCITY
**How fast do you cycle through failure tiers?**

**Measurement:**
- Time from Tier 1 failure → Tier 2 failure → Tier 3 failure
- Track: Days between "I made a mistake" and "I questioned my assumptions"

**Benchmark Progression:**
- Novice: Avoids failure (0 cycles per year)
- Intermediate: 1-2 Tier 2 failures per year
- Advanced: 1 Tier 3 failure per quarter
- Master: Designs Tier 3 failures weekly

**What It Measures:**
Relationship with failure (Force 7)
