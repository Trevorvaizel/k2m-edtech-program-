### Case Study 7: THE CEO WHO HIRED SLOWLY
**Force 8: Attention Economics**

**The Story:**
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos discovered: Most decisions are high-stakes (wrong). Most decisions should be low-stakes.

He realized:
- Type 1 decisions: Consequential, irreversible (need 70% information, not 100%)
- Type 2 decisions: Reversible, inconsequential (decide in 10 minutes)
- Most people treat Type 2 decisions like Type 1 (wastes attention)

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Attention economics: Strategic allocation on what matters (Type 1)
- Asymmetric leverage: 10% of decisions drive 90% of outcomes
- Context: Match decision quality to decision type

**The Universal Lesson:**
Your attention is finite. Spend 80% on the 20% that matters. Speed through the rest.
