### Path 2: TECHNICAL PROFESSIONS
**(Programming, Engineering, Data Science)**

**The Satellite View (Weeks 1-2):**
- Core concept 1: Input/Output (what goes in, what comes out)
- Core concept 2: Transformation (how input becomes output)
- Core concept 3: Constraint (efficiency, readability, maintainability)
- Map: All technical systems are input → transform → output

**Leverage Points:**
- 1 principle: "Make it work, then make it right, then make it fast"
- 2 techniques: Debugging + abstraction (80% of technical skill)
- 3 constraints: Time, resources, quality (force trade-offs)

**Time Compression:**
- Month 1: Build 10 small projects (debug + abstract each)
- Month 3: Context rotation (languages, domains, team sizes)
- Month 6: System design (combine abstractions)

**Invisible Forces to Watch:**
- Emergence: Components interact in ways you cannot predict (test everything)
- Context: "Best practices" depend on scale (what works for startup fails for enterprise)
- Failure: Most bugs are assumption failures (you thought X, but reality was Y)
