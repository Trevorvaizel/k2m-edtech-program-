### Practice 7: THE LATTICE AUDIT
**Weekly Practice: Connect Your Knowledge**

**The Process:**
**Once per week:**
1. List everything you learned this week
2. For each item, ask: "What does this connect to?"
3. Draw the connections (literally - paper or digital)
4. Notice isolated pieces (no connections)
5. Force connections for isolated pieces

**The Result:**
- Makes invisible lattice visible
- Strengthens connections (accelerates future learning)
- Reveals gaps in understanding
