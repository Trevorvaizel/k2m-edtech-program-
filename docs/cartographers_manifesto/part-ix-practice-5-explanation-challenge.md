### Practice 5: THE EXPLANATION CHALLENGE
**Weekly Practice: Can You Explain It Simply?**

**The Process:**
**Once per week:**
1. Pick your most recent insight
2. Explain it in 3 ways:
   - To a 6-year-old (simple analogies)
   - To a peer (technical but clear)
   - To an expert (nuanced and precise)
3. Record yourself explaining it
4. Notice where you stumble or confuse
5. Those gaps = what you don't actually understand yet

**The Result:**
- Reveals blind spots immediately
- Accelerates conscious mastery (Stage 5)
- Builds teaching skills (which accelerates learning)
