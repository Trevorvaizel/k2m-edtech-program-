### Case Study 5: THE WRITER WHO WROTE LESS
**Force 2: Time Compression**

**The Story:**
Author Stephen King discovered: Writing more hours ≠ writing more books.

He realized:
- Most writers spend 80% of time "preparing" and 20% writing
- He flipped it: 10% preparing, 90% writing
- Result: 60+ novels vs average writer's 1-2

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Time compression: It's not hours. It's density of connections.
- Lattice building: Each novel connects to previous ones (accelerating)
- Constraint: "2000 words daily" (time constraint forces focus)

**The Universal Lesson:**
10 years of sparse practice = 1 year of dense practice. Build lattice, don't just accumulate hours.
