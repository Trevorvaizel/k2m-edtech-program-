### Tool 1: FIRST PRINCIPLES DECONSTRUCTION
**Break Everything Down to "Why"**

**The Process:**
1. Take any technique/method/rule in your field
2. Ask: "Why does this exist?"
3. Ask: "What problem does it solve?"
4. Ask: "What would happen if I removed it?"
5. Ask: "Is there a better way to solve that problem?"

**The Result:**
You understand the principle, not just the technique.
Understanding principles = 10x learning speed.
