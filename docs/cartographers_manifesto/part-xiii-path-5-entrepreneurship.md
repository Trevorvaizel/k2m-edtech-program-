### Path 5: ENTREPRENEURSHIP
**(Business, Startups, Innovation)**

**The Satellite View (Weeks 1-2):**
- Core concept 1: Value (what problem do you solve?)
- Core concept 2: Leverage (what creates 80% of results?)
- Core concept 3: Risk (what can kill you?)
- Map: Business = value × leverage ÷ risk

**Leverage Points:**
- 1 principle: "Fall in love with the problem, not the solution"
- 2 techniques: Customer discovery + rapid experimentation
- 3 constraints: Budget, time, market (force focus)

**Time Compression:**
- Month 1: Talk to 100 customers, find 1 problem worth solving
- Month 3: Build minimal solution, test with 10 customers
- Month 6: Pivot or persevere (data-driven decision)

**Invisible Forces to Watch:**
- Emergence: Companies evolve into something different (you don't build the final product)
- Context: What works in one market fails in another
- Failure: Most startups die from building something nobody wants (not from execution failure)
