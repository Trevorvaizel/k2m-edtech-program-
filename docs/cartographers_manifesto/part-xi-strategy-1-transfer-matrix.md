### The Transfer Matrix
**What Transfers vs What Doesn't**

**Transfers (Principles - Layer 4):**
- Asymmetric leverage (80/20 thinking)
- Constraint-based learning
- Failure gradient climbing
- Context mapping
- Lattice building
- Attention economics

**Does NOT Transfer (Techniques - Layer 2):**
- Specific skills (chords, sutures, recipes)
- Field-specific tools (knives, keyboards, scalpels)
- Domain knowledge (anatomy, music theory, grammar)

**The Insight:**
Learn the principles ONCE.
Apply them across ALL fields.
