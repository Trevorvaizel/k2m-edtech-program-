### Practice 2: THE EVENING FAILURE REVIEW
**End Every Day by Designing Tomorrow's Failures**

**The Process:**
1. Review: What did I fail at today? (Be specific)
2. Classify: What tier of failure was it? (1/2/3/4)
3. Design: What failure do I want tomorrow? (Move up one tier)
4. Plan: What constraint will force that failure?

**The Result:**
- Removes fear of failure
- Makes failure deliberate, not accidental
- Accelerates through failure tiers

**Example:**
- Today: "I couldn't execute technique X under pressure" (Tier 1)
- Tomorrow: "I will attempt technique X at 2x speed until it breaks" (Tier 2)
- Next week: "I will question why technique X exists at all" (Tier 3)
