### Diagnostic Question 6: LATTICE DENSITY
**"How connected is my understanding?"**

- [ ] Each piece stands alone (low density, slow learning)
- [ ] Pieces connect to 2-3 others (medium density)
- [ ] Every piece connects to 10+ others (high density, exponential learning)

**Prescription:**
Use the Lattice Method - connect every new concept to existing knowledge.
