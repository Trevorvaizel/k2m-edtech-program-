### Principle 4: CONTEXT ROTATION
**Learn by Changing Worlds**

**The Pattern:**
- Learning in ONE context = fragile skills
- Learning in THREE contexts = adaptable expertise

**How to Do It (Any Field):**

**Rotation 1: Environment**
- Practice in different settings
- Change tools, materials, conditions
- Force adaptation

**Rotation 2: Constraints**
- High pressure vs low pressure
- Time limits vs no limits
- Different goals (speed vs quality vs creativity)

**Rotation 3: Roles**
- If music: Play alone, play in ensemble, conduct
- If cooking: Home kitchen, restaurant, competition
- If surgery: Trauma, elective, teaching

**Result:**
You learn not the skill, but **the principles behind the skill**.
