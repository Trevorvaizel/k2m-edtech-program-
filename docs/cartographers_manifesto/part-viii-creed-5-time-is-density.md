### Principle 5: TIME IS DENSITY
**Years don't make you better. Density of connections does.**

- 10 years of mindless repetition = 1 year of real learning
- 6 months of deliberate, principle-focused practice = 5 years of traditional learning
- **The slow path is actually the fastest path**
- **The fast path is learning the leverage points**
