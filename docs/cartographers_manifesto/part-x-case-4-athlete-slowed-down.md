### Case Study 4: THE ATHLETE WHO SLOWED DOWN
**Force 5: Emergent Complexity**

**The Story:**
Timothy Gallwey (The Inner Game of Tennis) discovered: Trying harder makes you worse.

He found:
- Tennis players who thought about technique performed worse
- Players who focused on feel (not mechanics) performed better
- The whole (athletic performance) CANNOT be found in the parts (individual techniques)

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Emergence: Techniques combine to create properties none contain
- Attention economics: Focus on outcome, not mechanics = better performance
- Layer 4: Invisible "feel" matters more than visible mechanics

**The Universal Lesson:**
You cannot master complexity by assembling parts. Focus on the emergent whole, not the individual techniques.
