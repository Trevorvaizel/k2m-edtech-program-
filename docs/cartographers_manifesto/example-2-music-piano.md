### Example 2: MUSIC (PIANO)
**Visible:** The performance
**Mechanics:** Scales, chords, sight-reading, technique
**Dynamics:** Phrasing, timing, expression, interpretation
**Invisible:** Harmony theory, rhythm as foundation, emotional architecture, silence as music

**Leverage Points:**
- 3 chords: I, IV, V = 80% of pop music
- Rhythm + melody = 90% of musicality
- Scales are derivative, not foundational (harmony first)

**Time Compression:**
- Master I-IV-V harmony (1 month)
- Master rhythm + melody (3 months)
- Context rotation: genres, ensemble vs solo, composing vs performing (6 months)
- Result: 6 months to functional musician vs traditional 5 years
