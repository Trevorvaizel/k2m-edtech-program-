### Tool 2: CONTEXT MAPPING
**Know WHEN, Not Just WHAT**

**The Process:**
1. Take any rule/technique
2. Map the contexts where it works
3. Map the contexts where it fails
4. Map the boundary between them
5. Name the contexts

**The Result:**
You become context-aware (Level 2 of Force 6).
You stop applying rules blindly.
You start matching approach to situation.
