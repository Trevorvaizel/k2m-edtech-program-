### Integration Strategy 1: PARALLEL MASTERY
**Learn Multiple Fields Simultaneously**

**The Old Way:**
- Master field A (10 years)
- Then master field B (10 years)
- Total: 20 years

**The Parallel Way:**
- Learn Layer 4 principles in field A (1 year)
- Apply those SAME principles to field B (1 year)
- Result: Competence in BOTH fields in 2 years

**Why It Works:**
- Principles are field-agnostic
- Each field reinforces the principles
- Cross-field connections build lattice faster

**Example:**
- Learn asymmetric leverage in cooking (salt/acid/heat)
- Apply to music (rhythm/harmony/melody)
- Apply to programming (data/transform/flow)
- Result: 3 fields in 3 years vs 10 years each
