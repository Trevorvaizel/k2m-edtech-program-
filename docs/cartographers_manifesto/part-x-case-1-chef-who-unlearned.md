### Case Study 1: THE CHEF WHO UNLEARNED EVERYTHING
**Force 4: The Beginner's Mind Paradox**

**The Story:**
Chef Jiro Ono (Jiro Dreams of Sushi) spent 60 years mastering sushi. At age 75, he realized: "I forgot how to learn."

He went back to apprentice mode, working under younger chefs, questioning every assumption he'd held for decades.

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Stage 5 (Conscious Mastery) → Stage 7 (Empty Chair)
- Unlearning 60 years of certainty to see deeper
- Paradox: Had to forget what he "knew" to reach true mastery

**The Result:**
- Transformed sushi from craft to art
- Created entirely new techniques by questioning fundamentals
- Stage 6: His presence transforms the dining experience

**The Universal Lesson:**
Mastery requires cyclic forgetting. The more you know, the harder it is to see. Periodically return to "I know nothing."
