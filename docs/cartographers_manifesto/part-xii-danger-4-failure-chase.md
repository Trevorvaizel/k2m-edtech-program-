### Danger 4: THE FAILURE CHASE
**Growth Without Direction**

**The Problem:**
- "Fail often" becomes "fail randomly"
- You seek Tier 3 failures (assumption failures)
- But you're questioning assumptions that don't matter

**The Example:**
- Entrepreneurs who "pivot" constantly
- Every "failure" teaches something
- But they're not building towards anything (just failing in new directions)

**The Antidote:**
Before failing, ask: "Does this assumption matter?"
Test leverage points, not edge cases.

**Principle:**
Fail on the 20% that matters. Not the 80% that doesn't.
