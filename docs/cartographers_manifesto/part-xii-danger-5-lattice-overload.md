### Danger 5: THE LATTICE OVERLOAD
**Connections Without Quality**

**The Problem:**
- "Connect everything" becomes "force connections everywhere"
- You build lattice between weak concepts
- Result: Strong connections to bad ideas

**The Example:**
- Conspiracy theories: "Everything connects to everything"
- They use lattice method correctly
- But the starting concepts are wrong

**The Antidote:**
Quality before connection.
Verify the concept BEFORE connecting it.

**Principle:**
A dense lattice of bad ideas is worse than no lattice at all.
