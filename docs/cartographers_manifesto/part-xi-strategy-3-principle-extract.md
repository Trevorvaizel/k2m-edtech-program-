### Integration Strategy 2: THE PRINCIPLE EXTRACT
**Pull Principles From Any Experience**

**The Process:**
1. Do ANY activity (watching a movie, playing a game, fixing a sink)
2. Ask: "What made this work or fail?"
3. Extract the principle (not the technique)
4. Ask: "Where else does this principle apply?"
5. Integrate into your primary field

**Example:**
- Experience: Watching a thriller movie
- Observation: Tension comes from what's NOT shown
- Principle: Constraints (what you hide) create more impact than what you show
- Application to cooking: "Don't put every ingredient on the plate"
- Application to music: "Silence matters more than sound"
- Application to writing: "What you don't say is more powerful"

**The Result:**
Every experience becomes learning material.
Every field becomes a teacher for your primary field.
