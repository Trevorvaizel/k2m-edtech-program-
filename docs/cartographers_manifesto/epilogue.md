## EPILOGUE: THE INVITATION

**You now have the map.**

But the map is not the territory.

The invisible forces I've described:
- They are real
- They govern all expertise
- They work in every field
- They are accessible to anyone

**BUT:**

Reading about them is not the same as experiencing them.
Understanding them is not the same as embodying them.
Teaching them is not the same as living them.

**The only way to know these forces is to:**

1. Pick a field (any field)
2. Walk the path
3. Experience the stages
4. Feel the forces
5. Come back
6. Read this again

**The second time you read this, you will see what you cannot see now.**

**The third time, you will see what I cannot see.**

**That is the territory.**
