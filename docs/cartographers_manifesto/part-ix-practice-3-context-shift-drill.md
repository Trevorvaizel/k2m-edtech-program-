### Practice 3: THE CONTEXT SHIFT DRILL
**Weekly Practice: Change Your World**

**The Process:**
**Once per week, practice your skill in:**
- Different environment (coffee shop vs studio vs outside)
- Different constraint (time limit vs tool limit vs outcome limit)
- Different role (performer vs observer vs teacher)

**The Result:**
- Separates principles from techniques
- Builds adaptive expertise
- Reveals what transfers (principles) vs what doesn't (methods)

**Journal After Each Session:**
- What still worked? (These are principles)
- What broke? (These are techniques)
- What surprised me? (These are blind spots)
