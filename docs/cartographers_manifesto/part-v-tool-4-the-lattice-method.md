### Tool 4: THE LATTICE METHOD
**Connect Everything to Everything**

**The Process:**
1. Learn a new concept
2. Immediately ask: "What does this connect to?"
3. Map the connection
4. Test the connection
5. Refine your mental model

**The Result:**
Every new piece of knowledge:
- Connects to existing knowledge
- Strengthens the entire lattice
- Makes future learning faster

**This is the mechanism behind Time Compression (Force 2).**
