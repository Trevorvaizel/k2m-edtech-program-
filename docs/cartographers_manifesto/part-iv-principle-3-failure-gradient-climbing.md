### Principle 3: FAILURE GRADIENT CLIMBING
**Design Your Mistakes Upward**

**The Pattern:**
- Novices: Avoid failure → Stop growing
- Masters: Design failure → Grow faster

**How to Do It:**

**Tier 1 Failures** (Early learning):
- Make as many surface mistakes as possible
- Fail fast, fail forward
- Goal: Volume of errors

**Tier 2 Failures** (Intermediate):
- Push until methods break
- Find where techniques stop working
- Goal: Discover boundaries

**Tier 3 Failures** (Advanced):
- Challenge your assumptions
- Test what you "know for sure"
- Goal: Shatter beliefs

**Tier 4 Failures** (Mastery):
- Question your identity
- "Who am I in this field?"
- Goal: Rebuild from first principles

**The Framework:**
- Spend 70% of time in your comfort zone (reinforcing)
- Spend 20% of time at your edge (stretching)
- Spend 10% of time beyond your edge (transforming)
