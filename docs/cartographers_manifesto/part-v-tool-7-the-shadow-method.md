### Tool 7: THE SHADOW METHOD
**Learn from Opposites**

**The Process:**
1. Find someone in your field who is the opposite of you
2. Study their approach
3. Reverse-engineer their assumptions
4. Test their methods
5. Integrate what works

**Why It Works:**
- Your style has blind spots
- Opposites reveal those blind spots
- Integration = versatility = mastery

**The Result:**
You become adaptive, not rigid.
You can shift contexts deliberately.
