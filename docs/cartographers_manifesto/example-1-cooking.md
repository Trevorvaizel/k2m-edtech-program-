### Example 1: COOKING
**Visible:** The plated dish
**Mechanics:** Knife skills, recipes, techniques
**Dynamics:** Flavor pairing, timing, temperature management
**Invisible:** Flavor theory, ingredient constraints, cultural patterns, creativity through limits

**Leverage Points:**
- Salt + acid + heat = 80% of flavor
- 5 techniques (sear, roast, braise, sauté, grill) = 90% of cooking

**Time Compression:**
- Master salt + acid + heat (1 month)
- Master 5 techniques (3 months)
- Context rotation: cuisines, ingredients, environments (6 months)
- Result: 3 years to professional competence vs traditional 10 years
