### Principle 1: SATELLITE VIEW FIRST
**See the Whole Before the Parts**

**The Old Way (Wrong):**
- Start with basics
- Build up piece by piece
- Hope it connects eventually
- Takes 10 years

**The Satellite Way (Right):**
- See the entire territory first (even if blurred)
- Understand how the major pieces connect
- THEN zoom into details
- Takes 6 months

**Why It Works:**
- Your brain needs a **schema** - a mental model of where pieces fit
- Without the schema, each piece is isolated (no lattice, no acceleration)
- With the schema, every new piece has a place (dense lattice, exponential learning)

**How to Do It (Field-Agnostic):**
1. Find the 3-5 core concepts that explain 80% of the field
2. Understand how they interact (not how they work individually)
3. Map the boundaries - what does this field NOT do?
4. Only THEN dive into techniques

**Example Patterns:**
- Music: Rhythm + Harmony + Melody → All songs
- Cooking: Heat + Time + Ingredient → All dishes
- Martial arts: Balance + Leverage + Timing → All moves
- Surgery: Anatomy + Exposure + Precision → All operations
- Programming: Data + Transform + Flow → All software
