### Metric 1: LEARNING VELOCITY
**How fast do you acquire new skills?**

**Measurement:**
- Time from "I don't know" to "I can do it competently"
- Track: Hours to reach basic competence in a new technique

**Benchmark Progression:**
- Novice: 100 hours to learn new technique
- Intermediate: 50 hours
- Advanced: 20 hours
- Master: 5 hours (lattice is so dense, everything connects)

**What It Measures:**
Lattice density (Time Compression - Force 2)
