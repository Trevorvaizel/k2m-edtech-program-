### Principle 2: CONSTRAINT-BASED LEARNING
**Learn Through Limitation, Not Freedom**

**The Pattern:**
- Too much freedom → Paralysis → Slow learning
- Strategic constraints → Focus → Fast learning

**How to Apply (Any Field):**

**Technique 1: The 80% Constraint**
- Pick ONE core technique
- Use ONLY that technique for 100 hours
- Force yourself to solve every problem with it
- Result: Deep mastery of leverage point

**Technique 2: The Time Constraint**
- Give yourself 1/10th the time you think you need
- Force improvisation
- Result: Learn what actually matters vs what's nice-to-have

**Technique 3: The Tool Constraint**
- Remove 90% of your tools/options
- Work with primitive constraints
- Result: Understand first principles

**Why It Works:**
Constraints force you to **find the leverage points** (Force 1).
Leverage points are where expertise lives.
