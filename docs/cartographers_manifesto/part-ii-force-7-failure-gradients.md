### Force 7: FAILURE GRADIENTS
**The Hierarchy of Learning from Being Wrong**

**Not all failures teach equally. There is a hierarchy:**

**Tier 1: Surface Failures** (Novice mistakes)
- "I made an error" → Fix the error → Learn to avoid that error
- Low learning value. Easy to fix.

**Tier 2: Method Failures** (Intermediate mistakes)
- "My method is wrong" → Change method → Learn why methods fail
- Medium learning value. Reveals patterns.

**Tier 3: Assumption Failures** (Advanced mistakes)
- "My belief about how this works is wrong" → Question assumptions → Rebuild understanding
- High learning value. Reveals first principles.

**Tier 4: Identity Failures** (Master-level mistakes)
- "Who I am and how I think is the problem" → Transform self → Rebuild from scratch
- Highest learning value. Creates paradigm shifts.

**The Force:**
- Novices avoid failure (protect ego, stop learning)
- Intermediates fear failure (know it matters, don't know why)
- Masters **design failure** (seek Tier 3 and 4 failures deliberately)
