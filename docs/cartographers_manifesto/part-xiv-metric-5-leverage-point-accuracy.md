### Metric 5: LEVERAGE POINT ACCURACY
**How precisely can you identify the 20%?**

**Measurement:**
- When asked "What matters most?", how specific is your answer?
- Test: Given a problem, can you identify the 1-2 leverage points?

**Benchmark Progression:**
- Novice: "Everything matters" (no focus)
- Intermediate: "Some things matter" (vague)
- Advanced: "These 3 things matter" (specific)
- Master: "This ONE thing matters, here's why" (precise)

**What It Measures:**
Asymmetric leverage (Force 1)
