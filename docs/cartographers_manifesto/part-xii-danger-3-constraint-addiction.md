### Danger 3: THE CONSTRAINT ADDICTION
**Freedom Becomes Fear**

**The Problem:**
- Constraints accelerate learning
- But over-reliance on constraints creates dependency
- "I can only create under pressure" = still a limitation

**The Example:**
- Writers who claim "I need a deadline or I can't write"
- They've built dependency on external constraints
- True mastery: Create internally, not react to pressure

**The Antidote:**
Rotate constraint phases with freedom phases.
Build both muscles: Focus AND exploration.

**Principle:**
Constraints are a tool, not a crutch.
