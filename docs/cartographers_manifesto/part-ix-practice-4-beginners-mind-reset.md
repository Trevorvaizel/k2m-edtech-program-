### Practice 4: THE BEGINNER'S MIND RESET
**Monthly Practice: Return to Zero**

**The Process:**
**Once per month:**
1. Pick your most fundamental belief about your field
2. Ask: "What if this is completely wrong?"
3. Spend 1 hour exploring the opposite perspective
4. Test it experimentally

**The Result:**
- Breaks certainty loops
- Prevents plateau at Stage 3
- Forces re-engagement with invisible forces

**Examples:**
- Musician: "What if rhythm matters more than harmony?" (Test: Create rhythm-only compositions)
- Chef: "What if temperature matters more than ingredients?" (Test: Same ingredient, 3 temperatures)
- Programmer: "What if readability matters more than performance?" (Test: Optimize for clarity, not speed)
