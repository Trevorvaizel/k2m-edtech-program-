### Danger 2: THE CERTAINTY SPIRAL
**Mastery Becomes Arrogance**

**The Problem:**
- Stage 5 (Conscious Mastery) feels like Stage 6 (Unconscious Mastery)
- You think you see the territory
- You're actually just seeing a BETTER map (still not the territory)

**The Example:**
- Financial "experts" in 2008: "We've mastered risk"
- Reality: They'd mastered a specific map of risk (not the territory)
- Result: Global economic collapse

**The Antidote:**
Periodically return to Stage 7 (Empty Chair).
Remember: All maps are wrong. Some maps are useful.

**Principle:**
The better you get, the humbler you must become.
