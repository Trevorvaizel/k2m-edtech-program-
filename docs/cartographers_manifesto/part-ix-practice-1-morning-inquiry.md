### Practice 1: THE MORNING INQUIRY
**Start Every Day at Layer 4**

**The Process:**
1. Before starting work, ask: "What is the 20% that drives 80% today?"
2. Identify the 1-3 leverage points for the day
3. Ruthlessly eliminate everything else
4. Work ONLY on those leverage points

**The Result:**
- Forces attention to Layer 4 (invisible layer)
- Builds asymmetric leverage muscle memory
- Creates daily time compression

**Tracking:**
- Did I identify leverage points? (Yes/No)
- Did I work ONLY on leverage points? (Yes/No)
- If No, what distracted me? (Pattern awareness)
