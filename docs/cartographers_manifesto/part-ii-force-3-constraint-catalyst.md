### Force 3: CONSTRAINT AS CATALYST
**How Limits Create Possibility**

Every field operates under constraints. Masters USE constraints. Novices FIGHT constraints.

**The Pattern:**
- Constraint → Forces focus → Reveals essence → Enables mastery
- Remove all constraints → Create mediocrity → Hide fundamentals
- Haiku (poetry constraint) creates depth
- Sonnet form (structure constraint) creates beauty
- Time pressure (performance constraint) creates flow  
- Budget limits (resource constraint) create innovation

**The Invisible Truth:**
Creativity does NOT come from freedom.
Creativity comes from **working within constraints to find what's possible**.

**The Force:**
Constraints are not obstacles. Constraints are **lenses** that reveal what matters.
