### Path 1: CREATIVE PROFESSIONS
**(Writing, Music, Visual Art, Design)**

**The Satellite View (Weeks 1-2):**
- Core concept 1: Emotion/Resonance (what makes people feel)
- Core concept 2: Structure/Pattern (how it's organized)
- Core concept 3: Constraint/Limitation (what you leave out)
- Map: Great art = resonance + structure, within constraints

**Leverage Points:**
- 1 principle: "Less is more" (edit ruthlessly)
- 2 techniques: Your core craft (eg. melody + rhythm for music)
- 3 constraints: Time, tools, outcome (force creativity)

**Time Compression:**
- Month 1: Master core craft (2 techniques only)
- Month 3: Context rotation (genres, mediums, audiences)
- Month 6: Original work (combine techniques in new ways)

**Invisible Forces to Watch:**
- Emergence: Techniques combine to create "voice" (cannot be taught)
- Context: What works in one genre fails in another
- Failure: Bad art = bad constraints. Great art = perfect constraints.
