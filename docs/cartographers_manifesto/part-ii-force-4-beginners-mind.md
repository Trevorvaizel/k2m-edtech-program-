### Force 4: THE BEGINNER'S MIND PARADOX
**The Expertise Trap**

**The Paradox:**
- To learn, you need confidence (to try, fail, persist)
- To master, you need doubt (to question, test, refine)
- Confidence builds competence → Competence breeds certainty → Certainty kills growth
- The better you get, the harder it is to get better

**The Invisible Cycle:**
```
Novice: "I know nothing" → Learns everything (rapid growth)
Intermediate: "I know something" → Defends what they know (plateau)
Expert: "I know everything" → Stops learning (stagnation/death)
Master: "I know nothing (again)" → Re-learns with deeper understanding (transcendence)
```

**The Force:**
Expertise requires **cyclic forgetting** - unlearning what you know to see deeper.
