## PART I: THE FOUR LAYERS OF REALITY

### Layer 1: The Visible (What Everyone Sees)
**The artifact, the performance, the output.**

- The chef's plated dish
- The architect's building
- The musician's performance
- The surgeon's successful operation
- The teacher's engaged classroom

**Characteristics:**
- Tangible, measurable, observable
- 5% of the iceberg
- What novices obsess over
- What gets rewarded publicly
- **The trap: Focusing here creates imitators, not masters**

---

### Layer 2: The Mechanics (What Apprentices Learn)
**The techniques, methods, procedures, tools.**

- Knife skills, chord progressions, design patterns
- Recipes, formulas, frameworks
- "How to do X" tutorials
- Best practices, standard procedures
- Step-by-step guides

**Characteristics:**
- Teachable, codifiable, transferable
- 15% of expertise
- What schools teach
- What books document
- **The trap: Mechanics without understanding creates technicians, not artists**

---

### Layer 3: The Dynamics (What Journeymen Experience)
**The relationships between elements, timing, trade-offs, context.**

- When to use technique A vs technique B
- How changing variable X affects variable Y
- What happens under pressure vs in comfort
- Why rules work in some situations but not others
- The interaction between tools, materials, environment

**Characteristics:**
- Pattern-based, experiential, situational
- 30% of expertise
- What experience teaches
- What mentors reveal
- **The turning point: This is where most people plateau or breakthrough**

---

### Layer 4: The Invisible (What Only Masters See)
**The first principles, leverage points, emergence, failure modes.**

- Why the field exists at all
- What creates value vs what just looks like value
- Which 20% of actions drive 80% of results
- What will break before it breaks
- How to create new techniques, not just use existing ones
- The edge conditions that define the system's boundaries

**Characteristics:**
- Invisible to the untrained eye
- Counterintuitive to the intermediate practitioner
- 50% of expertise (but taught nowhere)
- What separates masters from journeymen
- **The territory: This is where expertise actually lives**
