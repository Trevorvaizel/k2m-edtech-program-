### Days 1-30: FOUNDATION
**Building the Satellite View**

**Daily Practice:**
- Morning: Identify 1-3 leverage points for the day
- Evening: Failure review (What tier? Design tomorrow's failure)
- Weekly: Context rotation (practice in new environment)

**Weekly Focus:**
- Week 1: Map your field (what are the 3-5 core concepts?)
- Week 2: Identify leverage points (what's the 20%?)
- Week 3: Design constraints (what will force focus?)
- Week 4: Test constraints (do they work? adjust)

**Check-in (Day 30):**
- [ ] Can I explain my field's 3 core concepts?
- [ ] Have I identified the top 3 leverage points?
- [ ] Am I working ONLY on those 3 leverage points?
- [ ] Do I have 3 constraints I practice under?
