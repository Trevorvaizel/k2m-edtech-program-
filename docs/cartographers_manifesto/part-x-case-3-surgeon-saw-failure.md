### Case Study 3: THE SURGEON WHO SAW FAILURE
**Force 7: Failure Gradients (via Inversion)**

**The Story:**
Dr. Atul Gawande realized: Studying success won't make you great. Studying failure will.

He instead:
- Studied EVERY surgical failure in his hospital
- Mapped the patterns: 5 mistakes caused 90% of complications
- Created a checklist (simple constraints) to prevent those 5 mistakes
- Result: 40% reduction in surgical deaths globally

**The Invisible Force at Work:**
- Inversion: Study failure, not success (clearer patterns)
- Constraint as catalyst: Checklist forces leverage points
- Failure gradient: Tier 2 failures (method failures) reveal principles

**The Universal Lesson:**
Success has many causes. Failure has consistent patterns. Study failure to find the leverage points.
