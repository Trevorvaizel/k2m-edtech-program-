### Path 3: PHYSICAL PROFESSIONS
**(Sports, Surgery, Manual Trades, Performance)**

**The Satellite View (Weeks 1-2):**
- Core concept 1: Balance (foundation of all movement)
- Core concept 2: Leverage (maximum output, minimum input)
- Core concept 3: Timing (when matters more than what)
- Map: All physical skill = balance + leverage + timing

**Leverage Points:**
- 1 principle: "Relaxation creates power" (tension kills performance)
- 2 techniques: Your core moves (eg. for martial arts: footwork + breathing)
- 3 constraints: Speed, resistance, fatigue (force adaptation)

**Time Compression:**
- Month 1: Master core moves under 3 constraints
- Month 3: Context rotation (partners, environments, pressure)
- Month 6: Competition/performance (apply under stress)

**Invisible Forces to Watch:**
- Emergence: Mind + body connection (you cannot think your way into performance, you must feel it)
- Context: Techniques that work in practice fail under pressure
- Failure: Most injuries are form failures (technique breaks under constraint)
