# PART FOUR: THE JOURNEY BLUEPRINTS

## How to Facilitate Each Shift

These are not curricula. They're **shift facilitation guides**. The goal is not to teach information but to create conditions for perception shifts.

---

## Journey 1: The Office Worker Path
**Zone 0 → Zone 4**
**"I don't use AI" → "I direct AI as part of my daily work"**

### Who This Is For
- Uses computers for work (Word, Excel, email, etc.)
- Little to no AI experience
- May be intimidated by technology
- Wants to stay relevant and effective

### The Journey Overview

```
PHASE 1: WONDER (Zone 0 → 1)
"Oh, this is actually interesting"
Duration: 1-3 hours
↓
PHASE 2: TRUST (Zone 1 → 2)
"It actually works for real things"
Duration: 1-2 weeks
↓
PHASE 3: CONVERSE (Zone 2 → 3)
"It understands what I mean"
Duration: 2-3 weeks
↓
PHASE 4: DIRECT (Zone 3 → 4)
"I control the quality"
Duration: 2-4 weeks
```

---

### PHASE 1: WONDER
**Goal:** Break the barrier of "AI is not for me"
**Duration:** 1-3 hours (can be single session)
**Mode:** Demonstration + Guided play

#### The Barrier to Address
"I'm not a technology person" / "This is for younger/smarter people"

#### The Shift We Want
From: "AI is something other people use"
To: "AI is something I could use"

#### Session Design

**Part 1: The Hook (15 minutes)**
Don't explain AI. Show something surprising.

Examples:
- "Ask it what to cook with these ingredients" (practical + fun)
- "Ask it to explain [their hobby/interest] like you're 5"
- "Ask it to write a poem about [their name/their pet]"
- "Ask it to help you with something you're stuck on"

The point: **Wonder before understanding.** Let them feel "wow" before "how."

**Part 2: The Mirror (20 minutes)**
Show AI doing something THEY do.

- If they write emails: Have AI draft an email they need to send
- If they make presentations: Have AI outline a presentation
- If they analyze data: Have AI summarize a spreadsheet
- If they write reports: Have AI draft a report section

The point: **"This is relevant to MY life."** Not abstract—concrete.

**Part 3: The Playground (30+ minutes)**
Let them drive. Zero pressure. Just play.

Prompts to offer:
- "Ask it anything you're curious about"
- "Ask it to help with something you've been putting off"
- "Ask it to explain something you've never understood"
- "Ask it something silly"

The facilitator's role: Stay quiet. Let them explore. Answer questions only when asked. Celebrate every discovery.

**Part 4: The Debrief (10 minutes)**
- "What surprised you?"
- "What might you use this for?"
- "What questions do you have?"

#### Signs the Shift Occurred
- Asks "Can it also...?" (curiosity activated)
- Laughs or expresses delight (emotional engagement)
- Thinks of their own use cases (personal relevance)
- Wants to continue playing (intrinsic motivation)

#### If the Shift Doesn't Occur
- The examples weren't relevant to them → Find what they care about
- They're performing (pretending to be impressed) → Create more safety
- Deep resistance → Identity work needed (see "Working with Resistance" section)

---

### PHASE 2: TRUST
**Goal:** Build confidence through real-world success
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Mode:** Supported practice with real tasks

#### The Barrier to Address
"What if it's wrong?" / "I don't trust it for important things"

#### The Shift We Want
From: "AI is interesting but risky"
To: "AI is a reliable tool for real work"

#### Week 1-2 Design

**Day 1-3: Low-Stakes Wins**
Use AI for tasks where being wrong doesn't matter:
- Brainstorming ideas (can't be "wrong")
- First drafts (will be edited anyway)
- Summaries of non-critical documents
- Email replies to non-critical messages

Goal: **Accumulate positive experiences.**

**Day 4-7: Medium-Stakes Application**
Use AI for tasks that matter but have safety nets:
- Draft important email (they review before sending)
- Outline presentation (they fill in details)
- Summarize meeting notes (they verify accuracy)
- Research a topic (they check key facts)

Goal: **Build trust through verified success.**

**Day 8-14: Real Integration**
Use AI as normal part of workflow:
- Reach for AI automatically when facing a task
- Have 3-5 go-to use cases established
- Experience cumulative time savings
- Develop taste for when AI helps vs. doesn't

Goal: **AI becomes habitual, not exceptional.**

#### Support Structure
- Check-in after Day 3: "What have you used it for? What worked?"
- Check-in after Day 7: "Any surprises? Any concerns?"
- Check-in after Day 14: "How has your workflow changed?"

#### Signs the Shift Occurred
- Uses AI without being prompted
- Has favorite use cases
- Says "AI can help with that" in conversations
- Trusts AI output (while still reviewing)

#### If the Shift Doesn't Occur
- They're not actually using it → Identify the friction point
- They had a bad experience → Process it, show counter-examples
- Trust is growing slowly → Be patient, add more low-stakes wins

---

### PHASE 3: CONVERSE
**Goal:** Shift from commands to conversations
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Mode:** Guided skill-building with reflection

#### The Barrier to Address
"AI doesn't understand what I really need" / "My prompts don't work"

#### The Shift We Want
From: "I give commands, AI gives outputs"
To: "I have conversations, AI understands context"

#### Week 1: The Context Discovery

**Experience 1: The Contrast**
Give same task with two prompts:
- Prompt A: "Write a marketing email" (vague)
- Prompt B: "Write a marketing email for [specific product] to [specific audience] with [specific goal] in a [specific tone]" (rich)

Compare outputs. Discuss what made the difference.

**Key insight to land:** "AI doesn't read your mind. Context IS the interface."

**Experience 2: The Explanation Practice**
Take a task they need to do. Before prompting, write down:
- What is this for?
- Who is the audience?
- What's the desired outcome?
- What tone/style?
- What constraints?

Then prompt with all that context. See the difference.

**Key insight to land:** "Explaining to AI is like briefing a smart colleague."

#### Week 2: The Conversation Practice

**Experience 1: The Multi-Turn Discovery**
Take a complex task. Instead of one prompt:
1. Start with the goal
2. AI responds
3. Clarify/add context
4. AI adjusts
5. Refine further
6. Continue until satisfied

Track how many turns it takes. Notice how output improves.

**Key insight to land:** "Conversation IS the skill."

**Experience 2: The Thinking Partner**
Use AI not for output but for thinking:
- "Help me think through this decision..."
- "What am I missing in this analysis?"
- "Play devil's advocate on this plan..."
- "What questions should I be asking?"

**Key insight to land:** "AI can be a thought partner, not just a producer."

#### Week 3: Consolidation

**Practice:** 5 real tasks using conversational approach
**Reflection:** What's different about how you use AI now?
**Milestone:** Have one conversation where AI "gets it" and they feel understood

#### Signs the Shift Occurred
- Naturally provides context before asking
- Has multi-turn conversations without prompting
- Says "let me explain..." when starting with AI
- Uses AI for thinking, not just producing

---

### PHASE 4: DIRECT
**Goal:** Take control of output quality through deliberate iteration
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks
**Mode:** Skill development with increasing challenge

#### The Barrier to Address
"The output is never quite right" / "Good enough is good enough"

#### The Shift We Want
From: "AI gives me what it gives me"
To: "I direct AI until the output is exactly right"

#### Week 1: The Iteration Discovery

**Experience 1: First Draft vs. Final Draft**
Take an AI output that's "good enough."
Spend 20 minutes iterating:
- "Make it more concise"
- "Strengthen the opening"
- "Add more specific examples"
- "Change the tone to more confident"
- "Restructure with the conclusion first"

Compare first draft to final. Measure the gap.

**Key insight to land:** "First output is raw material, not finished product."

**Experience 2: The Variation Game**
For any output, ask:
- "Give me 5 different versions"
- "Now make it more formal / more casual / more bold / more subtle"
- "What's a completely different approach?"

Discover preferences you didn't know you had.

**Key insight to land:** "You have opinions about quality. AI can execute them."

#### Week 2: The Direction Techniques

**Technique 1: The Role Assignment**
"You are a [specific expert]. Write this from that perspective."

Practice with 5 different roles. See how output changes.

**Technique 2: The Example Method**
"Here's an example of what I want: [example]. Now do the same for [new topic]."

Practice with 3 different types of output.

**Technique 3: The Constraint Method**
"Write this in exactly 100 words."
"Use only short sentences."
"Include exactly 3 examples."

Practice with increasingly specific constraints.

**Technique 4: The Critique Method**
"What's weak about this? How would you improve it?"
Then: "Now implement those improvements."

Practice on 3 different outputs.

#### Week 3-4: The Director Identity

**Practice:** Daily direction sessions
- Take one task per day
- Don't accept first output
- Iterate minimum 5 times
- Push for excellent, not good

**Project:** Create one thing you're genuinely proud of
- Could be an important email
- Could be a presentation
- Could be a report
- Must be something where quality matters

**Reflection:**
- "What's your process now?"
- "How has your relationship with AI changed?"
- "What quality standards do you hold?"

#### Signs the Shift Occurred
- Never accepts first output for important work
- Has personal prompting patterns/templates
- Takes ownership of quality ("I made this")
- Describes self as directing AI, not using AI
