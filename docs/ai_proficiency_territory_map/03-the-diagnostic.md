# PART THREE: THE DIAGNOSTIC

## How to Know Where Someone Is

The goal is not to label people but to **understand their current perception** so you can meet them where they are.

---

## Diagnostic Method 1: The Scenario Approach

Present realistic scenarios and observe how they respond. The response pattern reveals their zone.

### Scenario Set A: The Work Task

**Scenario:** "You need to write a proposal for a new project. You have ChatGPT available. Walk me through what you'd do."

| Response Pattern | Likely Zone |
|------------------|-------------|
| "I'd write it myself—AI can't understand our business" | Zone 0-1 |
| "I'd ask ChatGPT to write the proposal" | Zone 2 |
| "I'd explain the context first, then work with AI on a draft" | Zone 3 |
| "I'd iterate through multiple versions, directing the tone and structure" | Zone 4 |
| "I have a custom GPT for proposals that knows our format" | Zone 5 |
| "I'd think about how AI changes what a proposal could be" | Zone 6-7 |

### Scenario Set B: The Problem

**Scenario:** "Your team is drowning in customer emails. Hundreds per day. You have access to AI tools. What would you do?"

| Response Pattern | Likely Zone |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Hire more people" / Doesn't think of AI | Zone 0-1 |
| "Have AI write response templates" | Zone 2 |
| "Have AI categorize and draft responses for review" | Zone 3 |
| "Develop a systematic AI-assisted triage and response workflow" | Zone 4 |
| "Build an automated system that categorizes, routes, and drafts" | Zone 5 |
| "Redesign the entire customer communication system around AI" | Zone 6 |

### Scenario Set C: The Possibility

**Scenario:** "What's something you wish you could do in your work but don't have time/skill for?"

Then ask: "Could AI help with that?"

| Response Pattern | Likely Zone |
|------------------|-------------|
| Doesn't connect AI to their wish | Zone 0-1 |
| "Maybe, but I wouldn't know how" | Zone 1-2 |
| "Yes, I should try that" | Zone 2-3 |
| "Yes, and here's how I'd approach it..." | Zone 3-4 |
| "I could probably build something for that" | Zone 5 |
| "That's interesting—it makes me think about..." (systemic) | Zone 6-7 |

---

## Diagnostic Method 2: The Language Approach

Listen for how they talk about AI. Language reveals perception.

### Zone-Indicative Language

| Language Pattern | Indicates |
|------------------|-----------|
| "The AI" / "That AI thing" / "ChatGPT thingy" | Zone 0-1 (AI as foreign object) |
| "Use AI to..." / "Get AI to..." / "Make it..." | Zone 2 (AI as tool/servant) |
| "Ask AI" / "Work with AI" / "AI helps me" | Zone 3 (AI as assistant/partner) |
| "Direct it to..." / "Push it to..." / "Shape the output" | Zone 4 (AI as material to sculpt) |
| "Build with AI" / "Create a..." / "I made a..." | Zone 5 (AI as building material) |
| "Design the system" / "Orchestrate" / "AI-native" | Zone 6 (AI as architecture) |
| "What AI means" / "Implications" / "Transformation" | Zone 7 (AI as phenomenon) |

### Resistance Language (Reveals Barriers)

| Language Pattern | Reveals |
|------------------|---------|
| "I'm not technical" / "That's for tech people" | Identity barrier (Zone 0-1) |
| "Can you trust it?" / "What if it's wrong?" | Trust barrier (Zone 1-2) |
| "It doesn't understand what I need" | Skill barrier (Zone 2-3) |
| "Good enough" / "It works" | Patience barrier (Zone 3-4) |
| "I wouldn't know how to build that" | Identity barrier (Zone 4-5) |
| "I just need it to work" | Vision barrier (Zone 5-6) |
| "That's too abstract" | Groundedness barrier (Zone 6-7) |

---

## Diagnostic Method 3: The Experience Approach

Simply ask what they've done. Experience reveals zone more accurately than self-assessment.

### The Experience Ladder

Ask these questions in order. Where they stop saying "yes" indicates their zone:

1. **Have you used ChatGPT (or similar) at all?**
   - No → Zone 0
   - Yes → Continue

2. **Have you used AI for actual work (not just playing around)?**
   - No → Zone 1
   - Yes → Continue

3. **Have you had a back-and-forth conversation with AI to refine something?**
   - No → Zone 2
   - Yes → Continue

4. **Have you spent 10+ minutes iterating on a single AI output?**
   - No → Zone 3
   - Yes → Continue

5. **Have you created something with AI (custom GPT, automation, app)?**
   - No → Zone 4
   - Yes → Continue

6. **Have you designed a system where AI is a core component?**
   - No → Zone 5
   - Yes → Continue

7. **Do you regularly think about what AI means beyond your immediate work?**
   - No → Zone 6
   - Yes → Zone 7

## Diagnostic Method 4: The Self-Placement Approach

Show them the map and ask: "Where do you see yourself?"

**Important:** Their self-placement often reveals more through its *inaccuracy* than its accuracy.

| Self-Placement Pattern | What It Might Mean |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Places self accurately | Good self-awareness; ready to grow |
| Places self higher than actual | Unconscious incompetence; may resist "basic" content |
| Places self lower than actual | Imposter syndrome; may need permission to claim capability |
| Can't decide between two zones | At a transition point; experiencing the shift |
| Resistant to placement | Identity attachment; the map itself feels threatening |

## The Diagnostic Conversation Framework

A structured approach to diagnosing someone's zone in 10-15 minutes:

### Phase 1: Open (2 minutes)
**"Tell me about your experience with AI so far."**

Listen for:
- Language patterns (Zone indicators)
- Energy (excitement, fear, confusion, confidence)
- Specificity (vague = lower zone, specific = higher zone)

### Phase 2: Probe (5 minutes)
**Use 2-3 scenarios from Diagnostic Method 1**

Listen for:
- How they think about AI's role
- Whether they see themselves as user, partner, or builder
- Where their imagination stops

### Phase 3: Experience Check (3 minutes)
**Walk through the Experience Ladder**

Listen for:
- Where the "yes" answers stop
- Discrepancy between claimed and actual experience
- Enthusiasm or hesitation at each level

### Phase 4: Barrier Identification (3 minutes)
**"What's stopped you from going further with AI?"**

Listen for:
- The barrier language patterns
- Whether barrier is identity, skill, trust, or vision
- How attached they are to the barrier

### Phase 5: Confirm (2 minutes)
**Show the map. Ask where they see themselves.**

Listen for:
- Accuracy of self-placement
- Reaction to the map (excited, overwhelmed, skeptical)
- Where they want to go

## The Diagnostic Output

After diagnosis, you should know:

1. **Current Zone:** Where they are now (0-7)
2. **Barrier Type:** What's blocking the next shift (identity/trust/skill/patience/vision)
3. **Barrier Strength:** How attached they are to the barrier (light/medium/strong)
4. **Destination Interest:** Where they want to go (Zone 5A vs 5B vs 5C matters)
5. **Learning Style:** How they best experience shifts (doing, watching, reading, discussing)
6. **Readiness:** How ready they are to shift (resistant, open, eager)
