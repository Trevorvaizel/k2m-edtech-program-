# PART SEVEN: SPECIAL CASES

## Working with Specific Populations

### The Skeptic
**Profile:** Has heard about AI, thinks it's overhyped, resistant to trying

**Key insight:** Don't argue. Demonstrate.

**Approach:**
1. Acknowledge their skepticism ("You may be right to be cautious")
2. Don't try to convince with words
3. Find something they actually care about
4. Show AI doing that thing
5. Let them react in their own time

**Avoid:** Evangelism. Proving them wrong. Dismissing concerns.

### The Anxious
**Profile:** Worried about AI taking jobs, doing something wrong, looking stupid

**Key insight:** Address the fear directly. Create safety.

**Approach:**
1. Name the fear explicitly ("It sounds like you're worried about...")
2. Validate it ("That's a reasonable concern")
3. Create extremely safe practice space
4. Celebrate small wins
5. Build confidence gradually

**Avoid:** Dismissing fears. Rushing. High-stakes tasks early.

### The Overconfident
**Profile:** Thinks they understand AI better than they do. At Zone 2, thinks they're at Zone 5.

**Key insight:** Don't correct. Challenge.

**Approach:**
1. Accept their self-assessment initially
2. Give them a task at their claimed level
3. Let them experience the gap
4. Reframe as opportunity, not failure
5. Build from actual level

**Avoid:** Deflating them. Humiliating. Direct contradiction.

### The Time-Poor
**Profile:** Wants to learn but "doesn't have time"

**Key insight:** Make it about time savings, not time investment.

**Approach:**
1. Find their biggest time drain
2. Show AI handling it (quick demo)
3. Calculate time saved vs time invested
4. Start with highest-leverage use case
5. Build from quick wins

**Avoid:** Long courses. Comprehensive curricula. "You need to learn this first."

### The Senior Leader
**Profile:** High status, used to being expert, vulnerable to looking unknowing

**Key insight:** Protect their dignity. Frame as strategic, not basic.

**Approach:**
1. Frame as "strategic understanding" not "learning to use"
2. Provide private space to practice
3. Connect to business impact, not personal productivity
4. Let them discover at their own pace
5. Give them language to lead on AI

**Avoid:** Basic exercises. Public learning. Treating as beginner.

### The Non-Native English Speaker
**Profile:** AI works better in English; they work better in their language

**Key insight:** AI is increasingly multilingual. Test in their language.

**Approach:**
1. Show AI working in their language
2. Discuss when English helps vs. doesn't matter
3. Help them find language-switching strategies
4. Connect to tools localized for their market
5. Acknowledge the current limitation honestly

**Avoid:** Assuming English-only. Dismissing language concerns.

## Edge Cases and Troubleshooting

### "They completed everything but haven't shifted"

**Diagnosis:** Activity without transformation. Going through motions.

**Possible causes:**
- Not enough struggle (too easy)
- Not enough relevance (exercises vs. real tasks)
- Hidden resistance not addressed
- Wrong starting zone diagnosis

**Action:**
1. Stop and diagnose
2. Find what's not landing
3. Create disorienting experience
4. Address hidden resistance
5. Make it real (actual stakes)

### "They shifted back"

**Diagnosis:** Unstable shift. Reverted to previous zone.

**Possible causes:**
- Shift wasn't consolidated
- Bad experience shook confidence
- Environment doesn't support new behavior
- Too much too fast

**Action:**
1. Normalize regression ("This happens")
2. Identify what triggered reversion
3. Rebuild more slowly
4. Create environmental support
5. Consolidate before advancing

### "They're stuck between zones"

**Diagnosis:** At the threshold but can't cross.

**Possible causes:**
- Barrier not identified correctly
- Barrier stronger than realized
- Need more practice at current zone
- Ready but afraid to claim it

**Action:**
1. Name the specific barrier
2. Create targeted intervention
3. Find the minimum shift (not the full jump)
4. Celebrate threshold crossing
5. Stabilize before continuing

### "They want to jump zones"

**Diagnosis:** Want Zone 5 when they're at Zone 2.

**Possible causes:**
- Impatience
- External pressure
- Misdiagnosis of current level
- Fear of missing out

**Action:**
1. Test at claimed level (let them try)
2. Let them experience the gap
3. Reframe zones as building blocks
4. Show how current zone enables target zone
5. Build sustainable path
