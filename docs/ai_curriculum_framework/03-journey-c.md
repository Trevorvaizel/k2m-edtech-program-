## Journey C: THE BUILDER LEAP
**Zone 4 → Zone 5 (all branches)**

*For people ready to create, not just use. "I'm an AI user" → "I build with AI."*

### Who This Is For

- Already proficient AI users (Zone 4)
- Thinks "I could make that" but hasn't
- Interested in building/creating
- May or may not be technical

### Duration: 4-6 weeks

### The Core Shift

**Zone 4 → Zone 5**
- From: "I use AI tools others built"
- To: "I build AI tools myself"
- Barrier to address: Identity ("I'm not a builder/developer")

### Three Branches

Learners choose based on interest:
- **5A: Maker** — "I want to create things"
- **5B: Integrator** — "I want to connect systems"
- **5C: Analyst** — "I want to think deeper"

All three start with the same first experience, then diverge.

### WEEK 1: THE FIRST BUILD (All Branches)

**Goal:** Experience yourself as a creator. One working thing.

*Experience: Build a Custom GPT*

Project: Build a custom GPT for something YOU actually need.

Examples:
- Meeting summarizer with your format
- Email responder in your voice
- Document analyzer for your domain
- Specialized assistant for your workflow

Process:
1. Identify the need (what do you do repeatedly with AI?)
2. Design the instructions (what should it always know/do?)
3. Build and test
4. Iterate until useful
5. Share with someone

Key insight: "I just built something. I'm a builder now."

**Shift Sign:** Says "I could make that" when encountering problems.

### WEEKS 2-4: BRANCH DIVERGENCE

#### Branch 5A: THE MAKER

*For people who want to create products, tools, experiences.*

**Week 2: Vibe Coding Introduction**

Project: Build a simple web application using AI.

Using Cursor, Replit, v0, or similar:
1. Describe what you want
2. Let AI generate code
3. Test and iterate
4. Deploy and use

Key insight: "Describing what you want IS programming now."

**Week 3-4: Real Creation**

Project: Build something useful that you or others will actually use.
- Could be a tool
- Could be an app
- Could be a game
- Must be real, not exercise

**Shift Signs:**
- Has created multiple working tools
- Comfortable describing software to AI
- Identity: "I build things"

---

#### Branch 5B: THE INTEGRATOR

*For people who want to connect systems and automate workflows.*

**Week 2: Automation Fundamentals**

Learn:
- Zapier/Make/n8n basics
- Trigger-action mental model
- Data flow between systems
- Common integration patterns

Project: Automate something with AI in the middle.
- Email arrives → AI processes → Action taken
- Form submitted → AI analyzes → Response generated
- Data updated → AI summarizes → Notification sent

**Week 3-4: API Understanding**

Learn:
- What APIs are (conceptually)
- How AI APIs work (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Basic API calling (can be no-code)
- Webhook concepts

Project: Build something that uses AI API.

**Shift Signs:**
- Thinks in terms of systems, not isolated tools
- Can design multi-step AI workflows
- Understands how AI connects to other software

---

#### Branch 5C: THE ANALYST

*For people who want to use AI for complex thinking and reasoning.*

**Week 2: Analytical Frameworks**

Learn:
- How to structure complex problems for AI
- Multi-document synthesis
- Decision modeling with AI
- Strategic analysis patterns

Project: Use AI to analyze a real decision you're facing.
- Map all variables
- Explore second-order effects
- Generate scenarios
- Pressure-test assumptions

**Week 3-4: Deep Partnership**

Project: Use AI for something that would take weeks manually.
- Research synthesis
- Market analysis
- Strategic planning
- Complex problem decomposition

**Shift Signs:**
- Uses AI for complex reasoning naturally
- Has developed analytical prompting frameworks
- Thinks "What would take me weeks manually?"
