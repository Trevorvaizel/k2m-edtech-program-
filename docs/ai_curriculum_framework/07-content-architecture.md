# PART SEVEN: CONTENT ARCHITECTURE

## What Content To Create (And What Not To)

---

## The Principle

**Content supports experience. Content does not replace experience.**

Most curricula fail because they lead with content. "Here's what you need to know."

This curriculum leads with experience. "Here's what you need to feel/see/do."

Content comes after—answering questions that arise from experience.

---

## Content Types by Function

### Type 1: Experience Triggers

Content that sets up experiences.

- Short videos showing what's possible (not how)
- "Try this" prompts
- Challenge framing
- Before/after comparisons

**Characteristic:** Creates curiosity or dissonance. Doesn't explain.

### Type 2: Just-In-Time Reference

Content that answers questions arising from experience.

- Technique libraries (searchable, not sequential)
- Troubleshooting guides
- "What went wrong?" diagnostics
- Tool tutorials (only when needed)

**Characteristic:** Available when needed. Never assigned proactively.

### Type 3: Reflection Scaffolds

Content that helps process experiences.

- Reflection prompts
- Journaling templates
- "What shifted?" frameworks
- Before/after self-assessment

**Characteristic:** Helps them name what happened. Doesn't tell them what should happen.

### Type 4: Community Catalysts

Content that enables peer learning.

- Discussion prompts
- Sharing templates ("What I built", "What I learned")
- Peer feedback frameworks
- "Ask me anything" structures

**Characteristic:** Multiplies perspectives. Creates "I'm not alone."

### Type 5: Consolidation Resources

Content for after shifts occur.

- Deep-dive articles
- Comprehensive references
- Advanced techniques
- Further exploration paths

**Characteristic:** For people who want more after shifting. Never before.

## Content Anti-Patterns

**Anti-Pattern 1: Comprehensive Upfront**
- "Here's everything you need to know about prompting"
- Problem: Creates overwhelm, skipping ahead, intellectual understanding without experience

**Anti-Pattern 2: Sequential Modules**
- "Complete Module 1 before Module 2"
- Problem: Assumes linear learning, ignores that shifts happen unpredictably

**Anti-Pattern 3: Video-Heavy**
- "Watch this 45-minute explanation"
- Problem: Passive consumption doesn't create shifts

**Anti-Pattern 4: Certificate-Oriented**
- "Complete all modules to earn your certificate"
- Problem: Optimizes for completion, not transformation

**Anti-Pattern 5: One-Size-Fits-All**
- Same content regardless of starting zone
- Problem: Bores advanced learners, overwhelms beginners

### Journey B Content (Zone 2 → 4)

| Week | Experience Content | Reference Content | Reflection Content |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | "The Contrast" interactive, Context template | None yet | "What made the difference?" |
| 3 | "Conversation Log" tool | Multi-turn patterns library | "How has your prompting changed?" |
| 4-5 | "Iteration Challenge" | Direction techniques library | "Before/After" documentation |
| 6 | "Proud Creation" project | Advanced techniques | "Who are you with AI now?" |

### Journey C Content (Zone 4 → 5)

| Week | Experience Content | Reference Content | Reflection Content |
