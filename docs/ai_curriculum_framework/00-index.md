## Usage Guidelines

### For Curriculum Developers
- Start with `01-foundation.md` to understand the philosophy
- Reference specific journey files when building learning tracks
- Use `04-experience-library.md` for exercise design
- Consult `05-facilitation-guide.md` for training guides

### For Facilitators
- `02-diagnostic-system.md` is your entry point tool
- Journey files (03-a through 03-e) are your session roadmaps
- `05-facilitation-guide.md` is your methodology reference
- `06-assessment-system.md` for verifying learner progress

### For Program Designers
- `07-content-architecture.md` guides what to build
- `08-delivery-formats.md` determines packaging
- `09-implementation-roadmap.md` is your build plan
- `10-meta-framework.md` explains the strategic vision

## Sharding Strategy

This document was split using **Option A: Coarse Granularity with Journey-Level Focus**:

- **10 main parts** split into focused modules
- **Part Three (The Five Journeys)** further divided into 5 separate journey files
- Total: **15 focused modules** from original 1,846-line document
- Each file is verbatim extraction (zero reformatting)
- Enables parallel development by journey/part
- Optimized for different audiences and use cases
