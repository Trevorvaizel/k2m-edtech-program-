# PART ONE: FOUNDATION

## What This Framework Is

Not a course outline. Not a content plan.

**A system for creating conditions where perception shifts happen.**

The AI Proficiency Territory Map describes 8 zones (0-7). Each zone is a way of seeing AI. The curriculum doesn't move people through levels—it creates experiences that shift perception.

## The Core Principle

**Skills follow perception. Never the reverse.**

You cannot teach someone to iterate on AI output (Zone 4 behavior) while they still perceive AI as a task-completion machine (Zone 2 perception).

Change the perception first. The skills emerge.

## The Eight Zones (Reference)

| Zone | Name | Core Perception | Invisible Barrier |
|------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0 | Unaware | "AI is sci-fi / not real" | Identity: "I'm not a tech person" |
| 1 | Observer | "AI exists, others use it" | Trust: "What if it's wrong?" |
| 2 | Delegator | "AI does tasks for me" | Skill: "I don't know how to explain what I want" |
| 3 | Collaborator | "AI understands my intent" | Patience: "Iteration feels like failure" |
| 4 | Director | "I shape what AI produces" | Identity: "I'm a user, not a builder" |
| 5A | Maker | "I create with AI" | Vision: "I can't see the whole system" |
| 5B | Integrator | "I connect AI to systems" | Vision: "I can't see the whole system" |
| 5C | Analyst | "I think with AI" | Vision: "I can't see the whole system" |
| 6 | Architect | "I design AI-native systems" | Groundedness: "Philosophy doesn't ship" |
| 7 | Philosopher | "What does AI mean?" | — |

## The Shift Architecture

Every shift requires:

1. **Disorientation** — Current perception proves inadequate
2. **Safety** — Space to not-know
3. **Experience** — New perception is felt, not explained
4. **Integration** — Time to stabilize
5. **Environment** — Context that supports the new perception

Every shift threatens:

- Identity ("who I am")
- Competence ("I'm a beginner again")
- Stability ("the ground is shaky")

Every shift offers:

- Expanded capability
- New relationships
- Deeper understanding
- Continued growth
