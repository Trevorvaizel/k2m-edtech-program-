# PART EIGHT: DELIVERY FORMATS

## How to Package the Curriculum

---

## Format Options by Context

### Format 1: Self-Paced Digital

**Best for:** Broad reach, scalable, asynchronous learners

**Structure:**
- Diagnostic quiz → Journey assignment
- Weekly experience prompts (email/app)
- On-demand reference library
- Community forum
- Monthly live Q&A

**Shift-Enabling Elements:**
- Daily micro-challenges (can't skip ahead easily)
- Peer sharing visibility (see others' progress)
- Reflection prompts that require response

**Risk:** Easy to consume passively without shifting

**Mitigation:** Gate progress on experience completion, not content consumption

---

### Format 2: Cohort-Based

**Best for:** Deeper transformation, accountability, community

**Structure:**
- Fixed start dates, groups of 15-30
- Weekly live sessions (experience + reflection)
- Async practice between sessions
- Peer pods (3-4 people for accountability)
- Facilitator check-ins

**Shift-Enabling Elements:**
- Live facilitation catches resistance in real-time
- Peer witnessing creates safety and commitment
- Fixed timeline creates healthy pressure

**Risk:** Logistics complexity, facilitator dependency

**Mitigation:** Train multiple facilitators, document methodology

---

### Format 3: Workshop (Intensive)

**Best for:** Quick activation, organizational rollouts

**Structure:**
- Half-day or full-day sessions
- Focus on 1-2 shifts maximum
- Heavy on experience, light on content
- Follow-up support (office hours, resources)

**Shift-Enabling Elements:**
- Concentrated time allows full shift cycle
- In-person energy enables deeper experiences
- Immediate application context (back to work tomorrow)

**Risk:** Shifts may not stick without follow-up

**Mitigation:** 30-day follow-up sequence, accountability partners

---

### Format 4: 1:1 Coaching

**Best for:** Executives, high-value individuals, complex situations

**Structure:**
- Diagnostic conversation
- Custom journey design
- Weekly 1:1 sessions
- Between-session challenges
- On-call support

**Shift-Enabling Elements:**
- Fully personalized to their context
- Real-time resistance work
- Deep accountability

**Risk:** Not scalable, expensive

**Mitigation:** Use for high-value or complex cases only

---

### Format 5: Organizational Embedding

**Best for:** Company-wide transformation

**Structure:**
- Leadership alignment first (Journey D/E)
- Manager training (facilitation skills)
- Team rollouts (Journey A/B/C by role)
- Internal champions program
- Ongoing reinforcement

**Shift-Enabling Elements:**
- Environment changes alongside individuals
- Peer support is built-in
- Application context is immediate

**Risk:** Organizational resistance, competing priorities

**Mitigation:** Start with willing teams, demonstrate results, expand
