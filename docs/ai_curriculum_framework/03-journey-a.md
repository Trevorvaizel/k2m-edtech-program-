# PART THREE: THE FIVE JOURNEYS

Not levels. Parallel tracks for different starting points and destinations.

---

## Journey A: THE AWAKENING
**Zone 0 → Zone 2**

*For people who haven't really started. "AI is not for me" → "AI is something I use."*

### Who This Is For

- Little to no AI experience
- May be intimidated by technology
- Often says "I'm not technical"
- Wants to stay relevant but doesn't know where to start

### Duration: 2-4 weeks

### The Two Shifts

**Shift 1: Zone 0 → Zone 1**
- From: "AI is not for me"
- To: "AI is something I could use"
- Barrier to address: Identity ("I'm not a tech person")

**Shift 2: Zone 1 → Zone 2**
- From: "AI is interesting"
- To: "AI does real work for me"
- Barrier to address: Trust ("What if it's wrong?")

---

### WEEK 1: WONDER (Zone 0 → 1)

**Goal:** Break the identity barrier. They see themselves as someone who could use AI.

**The Experience Design:**

*Session 1: The Hook (15 min)*

Don't explain AI. Show something surprising.

- "Ask it what to cook with these ingredients"
- "Ask it to explain [their hobby] like you're 5"
- "Ask it to write a poem about [their pet's name]"

Let them feel "wow" before "how."

*Session 2: The Mirror (20 min)*

Show AI doing something THEY do.

- If they write emails → AI drafts an email they need to send
- If they make presentations → AI outlines a presentation
- If they analyze data → AI summarizes a spreadsheet

The point: "This is relevant to MY life."

*Session 3: The Playground (30+ min)*

Let them drive. Zero pressure.

Prompts to offer:
- "Ask it anything you're curious about"
- "Ask it to help with something you've been putting off"
- "Ask it to explain something you've never understood"

Facilitator role: Stay quiet. Let them explore. Celebrate every discovery.

**Shift Signs:**
- Asks "Can it also...?" (curiosity activated)
- Laughs or expresses delight (emotional engagement)
- Thinks of their own use cases (personal relevance)
- Wants to continue (intrinsic motivation)

**If Shift Doesn't Occur:**
- Examples weren't relevant → Find what they actually care about
- They're performing → Create more safety
- Deep resistance → Identity work needed (see Facilitation Guide)

### WEEK 2-3: TRUST (Zone 1 → 2)

**Goal:** Build confidence through real-world success. AI becomes habitual.

**The Experience Design:**

*Days 1-3: Low-Stakes Wins*

Use AI for tasks where being wrong doesn't matter:
- Brainstorming ideas
- First drafts (will be edited anyway)
- Summaries of non-critical documents
- Email replies to non-critical messages

Goal: Accumulate positive experiences.

*Days 4-7: Medium-Stakes Application*

Use AI for tasks that matter but have safety nets:
- Draft important email (they review before sending)
- Outline presentation (they fill in details)
- Summarize meeting notes (they verify accuracy)
- Research a topic (they check key facts)

Goal: Build trust through verified success.

*Days 8-14: Real Integration*

Use AI as normal part of workflow:
- Reach for AI automatically when facing a task
- Have 3-5 go-to use cases established
- Experience cumulative time savings
- Develop taste for when AI helps vs. doesn't

**Support Structure:**
- Check-in after Day 3: "What have you used it for? What worked?"
- Check-in after Day 7: "Any surprises? Any concerns?"
- Check-in after Day 14: "How has your workflow changed?"

**Shift Signs:**
- Uses AI without being prompted
- Has favorite use cases
- Says "AI can help with that" in conversations
- Trusts output (while still reviewing)

**If Shift Doesn't Occur:**
- Not actually using it → Identify friction point
- Bad experience → Process it, show counter-examples
- Trust growing slowly → Be patient, add more low-stakes wins
