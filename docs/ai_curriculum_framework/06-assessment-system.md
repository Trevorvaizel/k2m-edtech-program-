**Mistake 5: Ignoring Resistance**
- Pattern: Pushing forward despite clear resistance
- Fix: Stop. Name the resistance. Work with it, not against it.

# PART SIX: ASSESSMENT SYSTEM

## How to Know If Shifts Actually Occurred

Not "did they complete the exercises" but "did their perception change?"

---

## Shift Verification

### Zone 0 → 1 Verification

**The shift:** "AI is not for me" → "AI is something I could use"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Language | "That AI stuff" | "I should try that" |
| Affect | Distant, dismissive | Curious, interested |
| Action | No attempts | Has tried, even once |
| Self-concept | "I'm not technical" | "I could learn this" |

**Verification question:** "What would you want to try with AI?"
- Not shifted: "I don't know" / "Nothing"
- Shifted: Has specific ideas, even if basic

---

### Zone 1 → 2 Verification

**The shift:** "AI is interesting" → "AI does real work for me"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Language | "I should try..." | "I used it for..." |
| Usage | Experimented once | Regular use for real tasks |
| Trust | Skeptical of output | Trusts (with verification) |
| Integration | AI is separate | AI is part of workflow |

**Verification question:** "Tell me about the last time AI helped you with work."
- Not shifted: Vague or no example
- Shifted: Specific recent example with outcome

---

### Zone 2 → 3 Verification

**The shift:** "AI does tasks" → "AI understands my intent"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Prompting | Single commands | Context-rich conversations |
| Iteration | One-shot usage | Multi-turn refinement |
| Attribution | "AI didn't understand" | "I need to explain better" |
| Usage | Task execution | Thinking partnership |

**Verification question:** "Walk me through how you'd use AI for [complex task]."
- Not shifted: "I'd ask it to [simple command]"
- Shifted: "I'd first explain... then we'd work through... then refine..."

---

### Zone 3 → 4 Verification

**The shift:** "AI understands me" → "I control the quality"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Quality standard | Accepts "good enough" | Pushes for excellent |
| Process | Waits for AI to get it right | Actively directs |
| Ownership | "AI gave me this" | "I made this with AI" |
| Techniques | General conversation | Specific direction methods |

**Verification question:** "How do you know when AI output is done?"
- Not shifted: "When it makes sense" / "When it's good enough"
- Shifted: "When it meets my specific criteria" / "When I've shaped it to be excellent"

---

### Zone 4 → 5 Verification

**The shift:** "I use AI well" → "I build with AI"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Orientation | Consumer of tools | Creator of tools |
| Problem response | "Is there a tool for this?" | "I could build that" |
| Portfolio | None | Has created things |
| Identity | "AI user" | "AI builder" |

**Verification question:** "Have you built anything with AI?"
- Not shifted: "No" / "I wouldn't know how"
- Shifted: Shows specific things they've built

---

### Zone 5 → 6 Verification

**The shift:** "I build AI tools" → "I architect AI systems"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Scope | Individual tools | Integrated systems |
| Design approach | Feature-by-feature | Architecture-first |
| AI role | Added capability | Foundational component |
| Thinking | "How do I add AI?" | "How does AI reshape this?" |

**Verification question:** "How do you approach designing something with AI?"
- Not shifted: "I figure out what features AI can help with"
- Shifted: "I think about the whole system and how AI changes what's possible"

---

### Zone 6 → 7 Verification

**The shift:** "I build AI systems" → "I engage with what AI means"

| Evidence | Not Shifted | Shifted |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Questions asked | "How do I build this?" | "Should I build this?" |
| Scope of concern | Immediate project | Broader implications |
| Engagement | Technical only | Technical + philosophical |
| Orientation | Builder | Builder + thinker |

**Verification question:** "What questions about AI do you think about beyond your work?"
- Not shifted: "I don't really" / "Just technical stuff"
- Shifted: Genuine engagement with implications, meaning, responsibility

## Progress Metrics

### Quantitative Indicators

**Frequency metrics:**
- Times AI used per day/week
- Percentage of tasks where AI is considered

**Complexity metrics:**
- Number of multi-turn conversations
- Number of iterations per output
- Average conversation length
- Complexity of tasks attempted

**Creation metrics:**
- Number of custom tools built
- Number of integrations created
- Number of others helped/taught

### Qualitative Indicators

**Language evolution:**
- Track how they talk about AI over time
- Note zone-indicative language shifts
- Observe barrier language decreasing

**Confidence evolution:**
- Track willingness to try new things
- Track recovery from failures
- Track initiative in AI usage

**Identity evolution:**
- Track how they describe themselves
- Track "I can't" becoming "I can"
- Track consumer → creator shift
