# PART TWO: THE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM

## Before Any Content: Know Where They Are

You cannot design a journey without knowing the starting point.

### The Diagnostic Conversation (10-15 minutes)

**Phase 1: Open (2 min)**
"Tell me about your experience with AI so far."

Listen for:
- Language patterns (zone indicators)
- Energy (excitement, fear, confusion)
- Specificity (vague = lower zone)

**Phase 2: Probe (5 min)**

Scenario A: "You need to write something important. You have ChatGPT available. Walk me through what you'd do."

| Response Pattern | Likely Zone |
|------------------|-------------|
| "I'd write it myself" | 0-1 |
| "I'd ask ChatGPT to write it" | 2 |
| "I'd explain the context first, then work with AI" | 3 |
| "I'd iterate through multiple versions" | 4 |
| "I have a custom GPT for that" | 5 |
| "I'd think about how AI changes what this could be" | 6-7 |

**Phase 3: Experience Check (3 min)**

Walk through these questions. Where they stop saying "yes" indicates zone:

1. Have you used ChatGPT at all? (No = Zone 0)
2. Have you used it for actual work? (No = Zone 1)
3. Have you had a multi-turn conversation to refine something? (No = Zone 2)
4. Have you spent 10+ minutes iterating on a single output? (No = Zone 3)
5. Have you created something with AI (custom GPT, automation, app)? (No = Zone 4)
6. Have you designed a system where AI is a core component? (No = Zone 5)
7. Do you think about what AI means beyond your immediate work? (No = Zone 6)

**Phase 4: Barrier Identification (3 min)**

"What's stopped you from going further with AI?"

Listen for:
- Identity language ("I'm not technical")
- Trust language ("Can you trust it?")
- Skill language ("It doesn't understand me")
- Patience language ("Good enough")
- Vision language ("I wouldn't know how to build that")

**Phase 5: Destination (2 min)**

"What would you want to be able to do with AI that you can't do now?"

This reveals:
- Motivation
- Appropriate journey track
- How far they want to go

### Diagnostic Output

After diagnosis, you know:

1. **Current Zone** (0-7)
2. **Barrier Type** (identity / trust / skill / patience / vision)
3. **Barrier Strength** (light / medium / strong)
4. **Destination Interest** (which Zone 5 branch, or staying at Zone 4)
5. **Readiness** (resistant / open / eager)

This determines which journey they enter.
