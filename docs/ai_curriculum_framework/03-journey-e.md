## Journey E: THE PHILOSOPHER'S TURN
**Zone 6 → Zone 7**

*For architects ready to engage with meaning. "I build systems" → "I engage with implications."*

### Who This Is For

- Experienced builders (Zone 6)
- Feeling questions beyond "how"
- Interested in AI's larger meaning
- Often teachers, leaders, writers

### Duration: Ongoing (not a course—a practice)

### The Core Shift

**Zone 6 → Zone 7**
- From: "I build AI systems"
- To: "I engage with what AI means"
- Barrier to address: Groundedness ("Philosophy doesn't ship")

### THE PRACTICE (Not Curriculum)

**This isn't a course. It's an orientation shift.**

*Practice 1: The Question*

After building something, ask: "Should I have built this?"

Sit with the discomfort. No easy answer.

*Practice 2: The Implications*

Engage seriously with:
- What does it mean that machines can reason?
- How should we think about AI and human cognition?
- What becomes possible that wasn't before?
- What are we responsible for as builders?

*Practice 3: Teaching*

Teach AI to someone. Face questions you can't answer.

The gaps reveal what you haven't integrated.

*Practice 4: Writing/Speaking*

Articulate your perspective publicly.

The act of articulating forces integration.

**Shift Signs:**
- Asks "should we?" not just "can we?"
- Engages with AI implications beyond immediate work
- Takes responsibility for AI's effects
- Holds both building and reflecting simultaneously
