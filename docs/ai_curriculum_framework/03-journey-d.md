## Journey D: THE ARCHITECT PATH
**Zone 5 → Zone 6**

*For builders ready to think in systems. "I build features" → "I design architectures."*

### Who This Is For

- Has built multiple AI tools/workflows (Zone 5)
- Ready to think bigger
- Wants to design systems, not just features
- Interested in AI-native approaches

### Duration: 6-8 weeks

### The Core Shift

**Zone 5 → Zone 6**
- From: "I build AI-powered solutions"
- To: "I architect AI-native systems"
- Barrier to address: Vision ("I can't see the whole system")

---

### WEEKS 1-2: SYSTEMS THINKING

**Goal:** See the forest, not just trees.

*Experience 1: Reverse Engineering*

Study 3-5 AI-native products. For each:
- What couldn't exist without AI?
- How many AI components interact?
- What's the data flow?
- What are the architectural decisions?

Key insight: "AI-native is different from AI-added."

*Experience 2: The Limit*

Take something you've built. Try to scale it 100x.
- What breaks?
- What's the bottleneck?
- Where does feature-by-feature thinking fail?

Key insight: "Features don't scale. Architectures do."

---

### WEEKS 3-4: ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS

**Topics:**
- AI-first vs AI-added design
- Multi-agent systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Model selection and trade-offs
- Evaluation and testing
- Cost and latency considerations

**Project: Design on Paper**

Design (don't build yet) an AI-native system:
- Something that couldn't exist without AI
- Multiple AI components
- Clear data flow
- Evaluation criteria

---

### WEEKS 5-6: BUILD AND LEARN

**Project: Build the System**

Build what you designed.
- Accept it will be imperfect
- Learn from what's hard
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Reflect on gap between design and reality

**Shift Signs:**
- Thinks architecturally before building
- Considers multiple AI models and their trade-offs
- Designs systems AI-first
- Can explain AI architecture decisions
