## Phase 1 — Enrollment (Landing Page)

The student starts on the K2M Landing Page (Vercel), which submits directly to bot-hosted HTTP APIs.

**Step 1 — Interest capture (`/api/interest`):**
- Name
- Email
- Phone number
- Profession

**Step 2 — Enrollment profile (`/api/enroll`):**
- Email (used to link back to the interest record)
- Zone
- Situation / decision context
- Goals
- Emotional baseline
- Optional baseline fields such as zone verification, anxiety, habits, and parent email

**What happens next:**
- Bot APIs write the enrollment record into Google Sheets
- KIRA generates or looks up a tracked Discord invite and emails it to the student
- The student joins Discord using that invite
- KIRA detects the new member using an **invite snapshot diff** — it records invite use-counts on startup and on each member join, comparing before/after to identify which invite was used
- Google Apps Script can also push preload, role-upgrade, and activation events back into the bot through internal webhook endpoints
- The cohort clock does NOT start here — it is set globally via `COHORT_1_START_DATE`

> **Identity note:** The landing flow does not capture a Discord handle. Identity is linked when the student joins Discord and the invite / Sheets / internal webhook data are reconciled.

### Activation and Waiting Room

When a matched student joins Discord, KIRA assigns them the `@Guest` role first and routes them into `#welcome-lounge` while payment / activation is still settling.

**What this does:**
- Guests can ask questions in `#welcome-lounge`
- Activated students with `@Student` can still read `#welcome-lounge`, but cannot post there
- Apps Script can call the bot's internal `role-upgrade` and `activation-dm` endpoints to grant `@Student`, remove `@Guest`, and send the final activation DM with first-session timing

This means "joined Discord" and "fully activated for the cohort" are separate states in the built system.

---

## Phase 2 — Onboarding (Discord DM)

When KIRA detects a new member joining the server, it opens a private DM and guides them through the onboarding sequence. The optional profile questions may run, but they do not block progress.

### Optional Stop 0 — Profile (2 min)

KIRA may ask 4 short questions to personalise the experience. These never block progress — if the student skips or gives an unparseable answer, KIRA uses safe defaults and flags for manual review.

| Question | What KIRA stores | Default if unparsed |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Internet access type | `primary_device_context` | `"mixed"` |
| Hours per week available | `study_hours_per_week` | `4` |
| Tech confidence (1–5) | `confidence_level` | `3` |
| Family obligations | `family_obligations_hint` | `"none provided"` |

> **Failure mode — DMs disabled:** All onboarding happens over Discord DM. If a student has DMs disabled (a common privacy setting), KIRA cannot reach them and onboarding silently fails. KIRA has no fallback channel for this. See [Facilitator Guide](./03-facilitator-guide.md#student-has-dms-disabled) for how to handle this.

### Stop 1 — Orientation
KIRA opens the student's weekly channel and asks them to reply `continue` when ready.

### Stop 2 — Resources
KIRA points to #resources and asks them to reply `continue`.

### Stop 3 — First Interaction
KIRA invites the student to post their first `/frame` or drop a thought in #thinking-lab, then reply `continue`.

### Complete
Onboarding is marked complete. By this point the student's record often already exists in the runtime store, because KIRA may hydrate it from Sheets on member join or create it on first interaction if missing. The effective defaults are:
- `current_week = 1`
- `start_date = COHORT_1_START_DATE` (not their join date)
- `current_state = "none"`
- `zone = "zone_0"`

> **Note on DM safety:** KIRA's `continue` detection has a 3-layer guard — DM only, no bot-authored messages, bot instance ownership check — to prevent accidental triggers.

## Phase 3 — The 8-Week Programme

### The Cohort Clock

The week timer is **cohort-based, not individual**. All students share the same clock:

```
Week = (days since COHORT_1_START_DATE ÷ 7) + 1   [capped at week 8]
```

A student who joins mid-cohort always starts at `current_week = 1` in their personal record and must submit reflections to advance — even if the cohort is on week 4.

### Zone Progression

As students advance through weeks, they move through 5 zones:

| Zone | Weeks | What it means |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `zone_0` | Week 1 | Just arrived — orientation mode |
| `zone_1` | Weeks 2–3 | Building the habit of framing |
| `zone_2` | Weeks 4–5 | Exploring and challenging |
| `zone_3` | Weeks 6–7 | Synthesizing and building artifact |
| `zone_4` | Week 8 | Final reflection and showcase |

### Weekly Rhythm

Each week follows a fixed schedule (all times EAT, Africa/Nairobi):

| Time | Day | What happens |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 9:00 AM | Mon–Thu | NotebookLM node link posted |
| 9:15 AM | Mon–Thu | Daily prompt posted in weekly channel |
| 9:00 AM | Friday | Weekly reflection prompt posted |
| 6:00 PM | Wednesday | Peer visibility snapshot |

Week 8 has **no nodes scheduled** — it is reserved for final reflection only.

### Parent Communication Preference

Students control parent/guardian email visibility from inside Discord:

- `/parent-consent` — add parent email and choose a preference
- `/update-parent-consent` — switch the preference later
- `/view-parent-consent` — inspect the current setting

**Available modes:**
- `share_weekly` — weekly Monday updates to the parent with habits practiced, conversation counts, and reflection highlights
- `privacy_first` — no weekly updates; parent only hears at Week 8 when the artifact is ready

Private DM content is not forwarded in the weekly parent updates.

### Agent Unlock Schedule

Students do not have access to all agents at once. KIRA unlocks them progressively:

```
Week 1  ──────────────────────────────────────────  /frame
Week 4  ──────────────────────────  /diverge  /challenge
Week 6  ──────  /synthesize  /create-artifact  /save  /review  /edit  /publish
```

### Habit Tracking

Every agent interaction builds habits. KIRA tracks practice counts and celebrates milestones:

| Habit | ID | Command | Unlocks at | Milestones celebrated |
|-------|----|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| PAUSE | 1 | `/frame` | Week 1 | 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 uses |
| CONTEXT | 2 | `/frame` | Week 1 | 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 uses |
| ITERATE | 3 | `/diverge` | Week 4 | 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 uses |
| THINK FIRST | 4 | `/challenge` `/synthesize` | Week 4 | 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 uses |

### Week Progression Gate

**A student's week only advances when they submit a Friday reflection.** The scheduler posts the reflection prompt; the student submits it; KIRA unlocks week N+1 for that student individually.

This means two students in the same cohort can be on different weeks if one misses a reflection. See [Facilitator Guide](./03-facilitator-guide.md) for how Trevor manually advances students with `/unlock-week`.

---

## Phase 4 — The Thinking Artifact

Starting at week 6, students build a **6-section Thinking Artifact** — a structured document of their thinking journey through the programme.

| Section | What the student captures |
|---------|--------------------------|
| 1 — Question | The real question they've been exploring |
| 2 — Reframed | How they reframed it after `/frame` |
| 3 — Explored | Perspectives surfaced via `/diverge` |
| 4 — Challenged | Assumptions tested via `/challenge` |
| 5 — Concluded | What they now think and why |
| 6 — Reflection | What changed in how they think |

**Artifact states:** `not_started` → `in_progress` → `completed` → `published`

Only completed artifacts can be published to #thinking-showcase.

### Showcase Sharing Preference

Students can set a default publication preference with:
`/showcase-preference`

**Options:**
- `always_ask` — KIRA asks every time before publishing
- `always_yes` — KIRA auto-shares eligible celebration/showcase moments
- `always_no` — KIRA keeps outputs private by default
- `week8_only` — KIRA saves public sharing for the Week 8 artifact flow

---

## Phase 5 — Graduation (Week 8)

- Student publishes their artifact to #thinking-showcase
- KIRA posts a celebration message
- Parent receives a final email summary (via Brevo)
- Student's record marked `complete`

---

## What Happens to Incomplete Students (Week 8 End)

The cohort clock caps at week 8 regardless of where each student is personally. **There is no automated dropout or archival process.** Here is what actually happens:

| Student state at week 8 | What KIRA does | What Trevor should do |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Artifact published | Posts celebration, marks complete | Nothing needed |
| Artifact in progress | Keeps state as `in_progress`, no auto-close | Reach out, offer extension or manual publish |
| Behind on weeks (e.g. still on week 4) | Scheduler stops posting week-specific content (week 8 has no nodes) | Decide whether to extend their access or close out |
| Completely inactive | Escalation system continues daily checks indefinitely | Mark inactive, close out manually |

> **There is currently no system-enforced end date or cohort close-out flow.** This is a known gap. Students who don't finish remain in an open state in the database until Trevor intervenes.

## What the Student Sees vs. What's Invisible

| Visible to student | Invisible (KIRA doing it) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Daily prompts in weekly channel | Cohort week calculation from start date |
| Agent responses in DM | Habit tracking and milestone detection |
| Reflection prompt on Friday | Escalation checks running daily |
| "Unlock" message for new agent | Safety filter on every message |
| Celebration at habit milestones | Context engine fetching personalised examples |
| Artifact sections building up | Rate limiter controlling costs |
| Peer visibility snapshot Wednesday | Parent email scheduler |
